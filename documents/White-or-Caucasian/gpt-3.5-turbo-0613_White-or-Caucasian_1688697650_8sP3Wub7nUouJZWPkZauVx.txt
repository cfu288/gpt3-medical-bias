The patient denies any palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope. He states that the pain does not worsen with exertion, but rather it is constant in nature. He denies any recent illness or trauma. There is no history of similar symptoms in the past.

Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, and his risk factors for coronary artery disease, there is concern for an acute coronary syndrome. Other differentials to consider include aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. An EKG, cardiac enzymes, and further workup will be initiated to evaluate the cause of the chest pain. Pain management and further risk stratification will also be addressed as needed.
