Based on the patient's history and presentation of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm, ischemic cardiac etiology such as myocardial infarction should be considered. Other differentials such as musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pulmonary embolism should also be evaluated. Further assessment and investigations are required to arrive at a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management plan.
