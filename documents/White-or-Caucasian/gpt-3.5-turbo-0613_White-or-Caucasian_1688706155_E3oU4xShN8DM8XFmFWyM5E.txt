Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, a cardiac etiology, such as acute coronary syndrome, should be considered among the top differentials. Urgent evaluation with further investigations, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, is warranted to assess for myocardial infarction or other cardiac ischemic events. Other differentials to consider include pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, and esophageal pathology. Additionally, the patient's risk factors, including a 10 pack-year smoking history, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, further support the consideration of acute coronary syndrome. The patient will be closely monitored in the emergency department, and appropriate interventions will be undertaken based on further evaluation and test results.
