Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm and his past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential cause. In addition, a family history of myocardial infarction and the patient's age further raise concerns for cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, are warranted.
