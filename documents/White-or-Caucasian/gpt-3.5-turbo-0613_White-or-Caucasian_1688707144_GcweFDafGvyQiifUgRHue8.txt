Based on the patient's age, gender, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, it is important to consider cardiac causes of her chest pain, particularly acute coronary syndrome. Other potential causes including musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal reflux disease, or pleurisy should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray, will be performed to determine the cause of her chest pain. Pain management and cardiac monitoring protocols will be initiated while further workup is completed.
