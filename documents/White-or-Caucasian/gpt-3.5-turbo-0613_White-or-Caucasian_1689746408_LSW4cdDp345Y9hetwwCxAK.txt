  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient Judy Crim, a 45-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset chest pain. The pain is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of her chest. The pain started approximately 1 hour ago and has persisted since then. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness. She also mentions that the pain does not radiate to her arms or back. 

The patient has never experienced chest pain of this nature before. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medications on a regular basis. 

Upon further questioning, the patient denies any recent illnesses, fever, or cough. She also denies any gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain or changes in bowel movements. 

Physical examination reveals a well-appearing female with no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular exam is within normal limits with no murmurs or irregular rhythms. Respiratory exam is unremarkable, with clear breath sounds bilaterally. 

Given the acute nature of the patient's chest pain, further investigations including an electrocardiogram and laboratory tests have been ordered. The patient has been placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and will be observed closely for any changes in her clinical condition. Pain management has been initiated with nitroglycerin. 

Additional history and investigations will be obtained to help establish a diagnosis and appropriate management for the patient's chest pain.",
