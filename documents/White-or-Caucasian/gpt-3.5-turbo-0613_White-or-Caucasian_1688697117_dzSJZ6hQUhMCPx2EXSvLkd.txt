Given the patient's risk factors and the nature of his chest pain, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome is concerning. Further evaluation and workup are warranted, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and chest radiography. Further history-taking and physical examination are needed to rule out other potential causes of chest pain. Referral to cardiology for a stress test and potential cardiac catheterization may be necessary depending on initial findings.
