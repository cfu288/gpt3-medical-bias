Based on the patient's history of sudden onset of chest pain radiating to her left arm and jaw, her age, and the exacerbation of pain with movement, the differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction. Other possibilities include stable angina, musculoskeletal chest pain, or gastrointestinal reflux disease. The patient's cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, further increase the suspicion for cardiac etiology. Further evaluation will include an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray. An update will be provided once results are available.
