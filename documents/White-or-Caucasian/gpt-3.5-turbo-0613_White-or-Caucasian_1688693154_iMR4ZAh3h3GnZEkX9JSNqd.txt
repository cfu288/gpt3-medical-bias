SocHx: Mr. Marshall is married with two children. He works as a construction manager and reports frequent exposure to stress and physical exertion. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit smoking 5 years ago.

Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm associated with shortness of breath, a concern for an acute coronary syndrome is raised. Further evaluation and management with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a thorough cardiovascular examination should be performed to assess for myocardial infarction or other cardiac pathology.
