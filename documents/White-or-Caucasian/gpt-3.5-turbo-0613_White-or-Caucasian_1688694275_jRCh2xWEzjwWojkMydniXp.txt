HPI: The patient, a 48-year-old male named Victor Houk, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain started suddenly approximately 2 hours ago while he was resting at home. He describes the sensation as a pressure-like pain in his chest that radiates to his left arm. He rates the pain as 7 out of 10 in severity and states that it is not relieved by rest or changing position. He denies any associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea. He has a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and takes lisinopril and atorvastatin daily. He denies any recent illnesses, trauma, or significant stressors. He denies any similar episodes in the past.

PMHx: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia.

PSurgHx: No history of any surgeries.

FamHx: The patient's father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. There is no other significant family history of cardiac disease.

SocHx: The patient is a current smoker with a 20 pack-year history. He consumes alcohol occasionally. He denies any illicit drug use. He works as an accountant and denies any significant occupational exposures.

Given the patient's presenting symptoms of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm, along with the risk factors of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and tobacco use, a cardiac etiology must be considered a priority in the evaluation. Further workup is needed, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray, to rule out acute myocardial infarction and other cardiac causes of chest pain.
