[Based on the provided history of sudden and severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, the main concern is acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction. However, other differential diagnoses should also be considered, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal chest pain, and anxiety. Further assessment, including a physical examination and appropriate diagnostic tests, will be performed to narrow down the differential diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.]
