Based on the patient's symptoms of chest pain, radiation to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, nausea, and diaphoresis, there is concern for a cardiac etiology. Given the patient's risk factors for heart disease and family history of myocardial infarction, it is important to rule out acute myocardial infarction as the cause of her symptoms. A comprehensive evaluation including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and further risk stratification will guide further management.
