Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and risk factors, my primary concern is a possible acute coronary syndrome, specifically an acute myocardial infarction. Other differentials to consider include angina, myocarditis, or a pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.
