Based on the patient's history of severe crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, as well as her risk factors for coronary artery disease (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history), acute coronary syndrome must be considered as a potential cause of her symptoms. Cardiac monitoring will be initiated, labs will be ordered including troponin levels, an electrocardiogram will be obtained, and she will be started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Request has been made for a cardiology consult.
