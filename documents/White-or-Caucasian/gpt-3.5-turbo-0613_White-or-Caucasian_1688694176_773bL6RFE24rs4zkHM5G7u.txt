Initial Assessment: The patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm. Given the severity of his symptoms and his past history of chest pain, myocardial infarction should be considered. Other differentials to be considered include angina, musculoskeletal pain, and pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation and testing are warranted.

Plan: Obtain a 12-lead ECG, basic metabolic panel, troponin level, and a chest X-ray. Start the patient on supplemental oxygen, attach cardiac monitoring, and establish IV access. Notify the on-call cardiologist for further evaluation and management. Provide pain relief as needed.
