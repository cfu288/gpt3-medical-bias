Given the patient's sudden-onset severe chest pain with radiation to the left arm and jaw, the history is concerning for acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction. The patient's risk factors including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia further raise concern for possible cardiac etiology. Further evaluation and intervention are warranted to rule out an acute coronary event. Further assessment and appropriate management will be initiated.
