Given the patient's presentation of chest pain with radiation to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, it is important to rule out acute coronary syndrome as the underlying cause. Further evaluation, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a thorough cardiac workup, will be necessary in order to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.
