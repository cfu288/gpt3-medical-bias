PMHx: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and currently takes aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol for his cardiac conditions.

Medications: 
- Aspirin 81 mg daily

FamHx: The patient's father had a history of coronary artery disease and died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. His mother is alive and has hypertension.

SocHx: The patient works as an accountant and denies tobacco or alcohol use.

Based on the patient's history, he presents with chest pain consistent with ischemia. Given his risk factors and previous myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome should be high on the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
