Based on the patient's presentation of chest pain, radiating to the left arm and jaw, along with risk factors of smoking, family history of myocardial infarction, and age, there is concern for acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation and intervention are warranted to rule out myocardial infarction, including an EKG, troponin level, and cardiac monitoring.
