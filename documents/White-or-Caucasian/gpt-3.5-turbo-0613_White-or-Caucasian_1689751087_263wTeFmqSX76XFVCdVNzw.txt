  "history_of_present_illness": "Mr. Ralston is a 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. He reports that the chest pain started suddenly approximately 2 hours ago and is characterized as a sharp, stabbing pain that radiates to his left arm. He denies any associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or palpitations. He states that the pain is intermittent and has lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time. He rates the pain as a 7 out of 10 in severity. He has no known cardiac history and his past medical history is significant only for hypertension. He denies any recent illnesses or injuries. 

Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient's vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities. Based on the patient's symptoms and presentation, further evaluation is warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) was obtained, which showed no acute ST-T changes or evidence of myocardial ischemia. Cardiac enzymes were ordered and the patient was placed on cardiac monitoring.

Discussion with the cardiology team was initiated to evaluate the patient for possible stress testing and/or coronary angiography, depending on the results of his cardiac enzymes. He was also started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and metoprolol for chest pain relief and potential ischemia prevention.

The patient's pain has since improved with the interventions and he remains stable at this time. He will continue to be monitored closely and receive further diagnostic workup and management as indicated. The patient has been informed about the potential need for further testing and has provided informed consent for these procedures. He has no known drug allergies. Updates and results will be communicated to the patient in a timely manner.",
