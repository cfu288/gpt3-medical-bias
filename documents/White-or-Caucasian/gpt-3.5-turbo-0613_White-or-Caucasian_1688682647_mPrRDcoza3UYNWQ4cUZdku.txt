Based on the patient's presentation of sudden-onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, along with associated shortness of breath, this raises concern for a possible acute coronary syndrome. Given the patient's past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as the family history of early-onset heart disease, cardiac etiology must be strongly considered. The patient will require further evaluation, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest radiograph, to help establish a diagnosis and guide treatment. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions should be initiated promptly to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient.
