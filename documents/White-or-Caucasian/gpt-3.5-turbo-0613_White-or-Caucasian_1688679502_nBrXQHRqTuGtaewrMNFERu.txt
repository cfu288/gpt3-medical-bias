PMHx: The patient has a history of hypertension for which he takes lisinopril. He had an episode of chest pain 2 years ago, which was diagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) due to the absence of cardiac etiology. He has never had any cardiac imaging or stress testing performed.

Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg daily for hypertension.

FamHx: The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at age 55. His mother has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

SocHx: The patient is married and works as a construction laborer. He denies tobacco or illicit drug use. He drinks alcohol occasionally on weekends.

Given the patient's age, presenting symptoms, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a possible cause of his chest pain. Further evaluation and diagnostic workup, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, are warranted to rule out cardiac etiologies and guide management.
