Given the patient's symptoms of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, along with associated shortness of breath and nausea, there is concern for a cardiac etiology, such as acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation and workup will be initiated in the emergency department. EKG, laboratory studies including cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray will be obtained. [The patient will also be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and provided supplemental oxygen.] Pain control will be addressed with appropriate analgesic medication. Cardiology consultation may be requested depending on the findings of the initial workup. Follow-up with the primary care physician will be recommended for further management and risk factor modification.
