The pain radiates down his left arm and is associated with shortness of breath. He denies any exacerbating or alleviating factors and states that the pain has been constant since it started approximately 30 minutes ago. There is no history of similar episodes in the past. No other symptoms are noted at this time.

Given the patient's presentation of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath, concern for acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction, is high. Immediate further evaluation and management are warranted. Further assessment including EKG and laboratory tests will be performed to guide the next steps in the management.
