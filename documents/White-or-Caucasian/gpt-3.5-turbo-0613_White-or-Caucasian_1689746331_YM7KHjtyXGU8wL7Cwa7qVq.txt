He rates the pain as 8 out of 10 in severity. He denies any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. He has no prior history of similar chest pain. Given the possibility of cardiac origin, an EKG was obtained which showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, consistent with inferior wall myocardial infarction. The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen supplementation. Clopidogrel and a beta-blocker were also administered.",
