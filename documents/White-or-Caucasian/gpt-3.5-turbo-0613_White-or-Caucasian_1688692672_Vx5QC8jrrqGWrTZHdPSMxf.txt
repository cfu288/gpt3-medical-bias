Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm, it is important to consider possible cardiac causes such as myocardial infarction. The patient's medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol also increases his risk for coronary artery disease. Further evaluation, including cardiac monitoring, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, will be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's chest pain. A cardiology consult will be requested, and the patient will be closely monitored for any changes in his condition.
