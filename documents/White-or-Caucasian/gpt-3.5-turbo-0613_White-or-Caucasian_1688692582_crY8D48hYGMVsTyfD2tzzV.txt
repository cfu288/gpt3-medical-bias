Based on the patient's history of chest pain, radiation to the left arm and jaw, associated symptoms of shortness of breath and diaphoresis, as well as her risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a myocardial infarction must be considered. It is important to rule out other potential causes of chest pain such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), musculoskeletal pain, or anxiety. Further evaluation and testing, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzyme levels, and a chest X-ray will be ordered. Pain management and close monitoring will be implemented.
