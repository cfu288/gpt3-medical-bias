  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Selma Zampino, is a 45-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain started suddenly about 1 hour ago and is described as a sharp, squeezing sensation in the center of her chest. The pain radiates to her left arm and jaw. She rates the pain intensity as 8 out of 10. She denies any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She takes medications for both conditions, including amlodipine and atorvastatin. She denies any recent surgical history. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease, with her father having a heart attack at the age of 55. Socially, the patient is a non-smoker and denies any illicit drug use. She consumes alcohol occasionally. Physical examination revealed stable vital signs with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. No peripheral edema was noted. EKG was obtained and showed ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). As a result, the patient was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).",
