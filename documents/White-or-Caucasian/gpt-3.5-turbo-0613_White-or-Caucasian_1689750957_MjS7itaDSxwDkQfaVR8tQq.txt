  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Maureen Rush, is a 52-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She states that the pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is located in the center of her chest. She rates the pain as a 7/10 in severity and describes it as a squeezing sensation. She denies any radiation of the pain, shortness of breath, or diaphoresis. She reports no alleviating or exacerbating factors. She has no known cardiac history and does not take any medications. She denies any recent illnesses or infections. She arrived at the emergency department accompanied by her husband. On physical examination, the patient appears in moderate distress due to pain. She is afebrile with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs is clear bilaterally and there are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated on cardiac examination. Her abdominal examination is unremarkable. Neurologic examination is within normal limits. Initial ECG shows normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-segment changes. Given her presentation and risk factors, we are concerned about the possibility of acute coronary syndrome. Differential diagnoses also include musculoskeletal chest pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. A troponin level has been sent and we will await the results. In the meantime, the patient has been given sublingual nitroglycerin for pain relief.",
