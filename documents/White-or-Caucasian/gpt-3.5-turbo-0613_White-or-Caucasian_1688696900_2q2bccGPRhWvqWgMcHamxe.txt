Given the patient's presentation of sudden-onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, a concern for acute coronary syndrome, including myocardial infarction, is raised. EKG and cardiac enzyme markers will be obtained to evaluate for any possible ischemic changes. Immediate treatment measures such as oxygen therapy and sublingual nitroglycerin will be initiated as appropriate. The patient will be monitored closely in the emergency department, and cardiology consultation will be requested.
