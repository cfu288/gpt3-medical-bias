The patient's chest pain is concerning for a cardiac etiology, given the sudden onset, associated symptoms, and risk factors. The initial EKG does not show any acute ischemic changes, but given the high clinical suspicion, further evaluation, including serial troponin levels, is warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. The patient has been provided with sublingual nitroglycerin tablets for symptomatic relief and is being closely monitored.
