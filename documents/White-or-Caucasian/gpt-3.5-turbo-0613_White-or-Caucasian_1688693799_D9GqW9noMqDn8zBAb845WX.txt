Based on the patient's presentation of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, concern for a possible myocardial infarction is high. Further evaluation, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray, will be performed to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Pain management and monitoring will also be initiated. The patient will be kept on a cardiac monitor and given nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain. Consultation with cardiology will be considered based on further evaluations.
