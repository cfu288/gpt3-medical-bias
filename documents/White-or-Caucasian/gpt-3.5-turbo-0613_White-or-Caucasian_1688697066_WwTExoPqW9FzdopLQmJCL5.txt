Given the patient's age, gender, and presenting symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, there is concern for acute coronary syndrome. The differential diagnosis also includes other causes of chest pain such as myocardial infarction, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient will be further evaluated to rule out these possibilities, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and imaging studies as deemed necessary. Pain management and cardiac monitoring will be initiated.
