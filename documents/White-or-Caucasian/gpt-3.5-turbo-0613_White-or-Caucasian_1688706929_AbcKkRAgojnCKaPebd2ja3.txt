Given the patient's presenting complaint of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to her left arm, it is important to consider cardiac causes such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Other differential diagnoses include musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anxiety. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests, including an electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray, will be ordered to assess for cardiac involvement. Pain management and monitoring for any changes or worsening of symptoms will be implemented. A cardiology consult will also be requested.
