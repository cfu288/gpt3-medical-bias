The pain started suddenly while the patient was at rest and has been ongoing for the past 30 minutes. Patient describes the pain as a squeezing sensation in the center of the chest, radiating to the left arm. During my initial assessment, I noted the presence of diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95% on room air. EKG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4. Given the high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome, patient was immediately started on aspirin and nitroglycerin and was referred to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation and management.",
