Based on the patient's presentation and history, the possibility of cardiac ischemia, specifically acute coronary syndrome, is of concern. The patient's risk factors, including her age, smoking history, and the presence of chest pain radiating to the arm, are suggestive of cardiac etiology. Additionally, the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms makes acute coronary syndrome more likely. Next steps include obtaining an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and initiating appropriate treatment measures, including antiplatelet therapy, pain management, and further risk stratification as indicated.
