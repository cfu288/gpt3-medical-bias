Based on the patient's presentation of sudden onset chest pain radiating down his left arm and accompanied by shortness of breath and diaphoresis, the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is of concern. The patient's medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia further increases the suspicion. Immediate evaluation and appropriate interventions are necessary to rule out a serious cardiac event.
