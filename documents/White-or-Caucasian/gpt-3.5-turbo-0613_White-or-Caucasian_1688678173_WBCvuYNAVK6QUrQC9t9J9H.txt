Initial workup:

- Labs: Troponin levels pending.

The patient's presentation of sudden-onset, sharp, and stabbing chest pain raises concerns for cardiac etiology, such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Given the patient's risk factors of hypertension and age, further evaluation and monitoring are warranted. Pending the troponin levels, the patient will be closely monitored, and additional investigations, including a chest X-ray and cardiac enzyme panel, may be considered to rule out other potential causes of the chest pain. Pain management with analgesics will also be initiated to provide relief and improve patient comfort.
