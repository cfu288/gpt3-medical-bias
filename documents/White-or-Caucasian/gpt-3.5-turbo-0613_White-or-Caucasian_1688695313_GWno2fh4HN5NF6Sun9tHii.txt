Given the patient's presentation with sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, and her history of hypertension, a possible myocardial infarction should be considered. Other differentials could include musculoskeletal pain, anxiety, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Further evaluation, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray, will be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's chest pain. Pain management and monitoring of vital signs will also be initiated.
