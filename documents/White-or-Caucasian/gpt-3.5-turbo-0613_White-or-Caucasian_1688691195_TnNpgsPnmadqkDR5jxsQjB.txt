Based on the patient's presentation of chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, and the absence of preceding events or triggers, the differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction, as well as other cardiac-related causes such as unstable angina, pericarditis, or aortic dissection. Additionally, non-cardiac causes such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), musculoskeletal issues, or anxiety should also be considered. Further evaluation including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray will be done to help determine the etiology and guide management.
