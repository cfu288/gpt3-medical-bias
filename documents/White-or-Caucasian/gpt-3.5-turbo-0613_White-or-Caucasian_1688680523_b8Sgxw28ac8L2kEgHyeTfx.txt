The patient's symptoms of chest pain, radiating to the left arm and associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, are concerning for a possible cardiac etiology. Given his history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and family history of coronary artery disease, it is important to rule out an acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation with EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray will be necessary. Follow-up with a cardiologist will also be recommended for further management and risk stratification.
