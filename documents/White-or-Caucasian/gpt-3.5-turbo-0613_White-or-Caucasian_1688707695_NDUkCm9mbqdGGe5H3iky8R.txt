[Based on the patient's symptoms of substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, a concern for an acute coronary syndrome is the top differential diagnosis. I have ordered an ECG and laboratory investigations including cardiac enzymes to further evaluate the patient's chest pain. He has been placed on continuous cardiac monitoring in the emergency department. I will consult the cardiology team for further evaluation and management.]
