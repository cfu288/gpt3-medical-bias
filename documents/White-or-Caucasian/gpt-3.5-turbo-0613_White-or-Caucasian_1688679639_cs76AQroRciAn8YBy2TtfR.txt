Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain and the absence of typical angina symptoms, such as radiation of pain or associated symptoms, it is important to consider other potential causes of chest pain, such as musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal etiologies. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme levels, will be necessary to rule out any cardiac causes of the chest pain.
