  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Kendal Muscarello presents to the emergency department with complaints of acute chest pain. He describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation in the center of his chest. The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and has been constant since then. He denies any radiation of pain to his arms, neck, or jaw. He also denies any shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea. Upon further questioning, the patient reports that he has a history of hypertension and occasional episodes of acid reflux. His last blood pressure reading at home was 140/90 mmHg. Given the severity of his chest pain and his risk factors for cardiovascular disease, further evaluation is warranted to rule out cardiac etiology.",
