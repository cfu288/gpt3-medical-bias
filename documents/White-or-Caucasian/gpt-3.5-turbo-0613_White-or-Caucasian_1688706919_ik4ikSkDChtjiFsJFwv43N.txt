Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, a cardiac event such as an acute coronary syndrome should be considered. Given the patient's age, gender, and family history of heart disease, it is important to rule out a myocardial infarction. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing are warranted to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and appropriate management.
