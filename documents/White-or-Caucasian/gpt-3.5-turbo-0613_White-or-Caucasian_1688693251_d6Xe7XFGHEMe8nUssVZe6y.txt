Mr. Thomas is a 45-year-old male presenting with acute chest pain suspicious for a myocardial infarction. Given his symptoms, risk factors (hypertension, smoking), and family history of heart disease, urgent intervention is required to rule out an acute coronary syndrome. A 12-lead EKG will be obtained, troponin levels will be checked, and he will receive aspirin 325mg PO and nitroglycerin SL for pain relief. Cardiology will be consulted for further management.
