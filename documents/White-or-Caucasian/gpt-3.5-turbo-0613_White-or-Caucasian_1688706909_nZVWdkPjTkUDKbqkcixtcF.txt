Plan: Based on the patient's presentation with acute chest pain, further evaluation is warranted to rule out serious cardiac causes. An electrocardiogram (EKG) will be obtained to assess for any acute ischemic changes or arrhythmias. Serial troponin levels will also be checked to evaluate for possible myocardial injury. Pain will be managed with analgesics as necessary. Close monitoring of vital signs and continuous cardiac monitoring will be initiated. A chest X-ray may be considered if the EKG and troponin levels are within normal limits. The patient will be reevaluated after test results become available to determine the need for further interventions or consultations with cardiology.
