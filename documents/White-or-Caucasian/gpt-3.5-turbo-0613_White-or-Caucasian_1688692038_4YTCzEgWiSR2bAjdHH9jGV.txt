Immediate electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme testing will be ordered to evaluate for acute myocardial infarction. Chest pain protocol will be initiated, including oxygen supplementation, cardiac monitoring, and sublingual nitroglycerin administration. The patient will also be started on aspirin therapy unless contraindicated. A cardiology consultation will be requested for further evaluation and management.
