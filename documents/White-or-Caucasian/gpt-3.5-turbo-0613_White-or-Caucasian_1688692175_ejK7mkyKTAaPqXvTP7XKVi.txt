Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset severe chest pain radiating to the arm and jaw, along with her risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including her age, gender, hypertension, and family history, consideration should be given to ruling out acute coronary syndrome as the cause of her chest pain. Further evaluation and testing are warranted, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray.
