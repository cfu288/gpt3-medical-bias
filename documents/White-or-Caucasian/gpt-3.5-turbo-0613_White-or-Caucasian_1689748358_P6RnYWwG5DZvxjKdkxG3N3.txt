  "patient_name": "Mara Grether",
  "age": "35",
  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mara Grether, is a 35-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of her chest. The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and has been constant since then. She rates the pain intensity as 8 out of 10. The pain does not radiate and is not associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness. The patient denies any history of similar symptoms in the past. 

Upon further assessment, the patient reports that she has been feeling stressed lately due to work and personal issues. She has been working long hours and has not been getting adequate sleep. She denies any recent illnesses or injuries. She denies any history of cardiac or respiratory conditions.

The patient denies any other concerning symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, joint pain, rash, or neurological deficits. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She appears well-nourished and in no acute distress.

Based on the patient's history of present illness and review of symptoms, the differential diagnosis for her chest pain includes musculoskeletal pain, anxiety/stress-related chest pain, and possibly gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Further evaluation and diagnostic testing will be needed to determine the exact cause of her symptoms.

During the physical examination, the patient's heart sounds were normal, and there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient did not have any tenderness or reproducible pain upon palpation of the chest wall. Examination of the abdomen, extremities, and neurological system were within normal limits.

The patient has a past medical history of asthma, for which she uses an inhaler as needed. She does not take any other prescription medications regularly. She has no known allergies. Her past surgical history is unremarkable.

The patient's family history is significant for hypertension in both parents. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She denies any illicit drug use.

Based on the patient's presentation and examination, it is likely that her chest pain is related to musculoskeletal strain or anxiety/stress. However, further investigations, including an electrocardiogram and laboratory tests, will be conducted to rule out any cardiac or other serious conditions.

The patient has been informed about the possible causes of her symptoms and the need for further evaluation. She understands the plan and consents to the recommended diagnostic tests and treatments.

A detailed plan will be discussed with the patient once the results of the investigations are available.
