The patient is currently experiencing an episode of acute chest pain concerning for a cardiac etiology. Given the patient's symptoms of acute onset chest pain, radiation to the left arm, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, concern for myocardial infarction is high. [A 12-lead EKG should be performed immediately to assess for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).] IV access should be obtained, and cardiac monitoring should be initiated. Serial cardiac biomarkers should be obtained to evaluate for myocardial injury. The patient should be placed on supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%. Nitroglycerin may be considered for pain relief and to reduce myocardial demand, pending the absence of contraindications such as hypotension or use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors within the past 24 hours. Morphine may also be considered for pain relief, but it should be used cautiously in order to not mask changes in the patient's clinical status. [Consultation with cardiology for further management is recommended.]
