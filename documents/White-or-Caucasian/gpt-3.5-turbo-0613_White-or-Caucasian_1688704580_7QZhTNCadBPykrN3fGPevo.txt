Given the patient's age, risk factors, and presenting symptom of chest pain with radiation to the left arm, acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction, is a primary concern.

Pain relief will be provided as needed, and the patient will be closely monitored for any changes in his clinical status.
