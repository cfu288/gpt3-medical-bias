HPI: The patient, a 45-year-old male named Quinn Greer, presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain. He describes the pain as a crushing sensation in the middle of his chest that radiates to his left arm. The pain started suddenly about an hour ago while he was at rest. He denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or diaphoresis. The pain has not improved with rest or over-the-counter pain medications.

PMHx: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both diagnosed 5 years ago. He is currently on medication for both conditions, but he admits to being non-compliant with his medications recently.

Medications: The patient is currently taking amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension and atorvastatin 20mg daily for hyperlipidemia. He has not been taking these medications regularly.

PSurgHx: The patient denies any previous surgeries.

FamHx: His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 50. His mother is alive with no significant medical history. His sister has a history of hypertension.

SocHx: The patient is married and works as a manager at a local retail store. He denies smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. He exercises occasionally and has an unhealthy diet.

Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain that radiates to the left arm, and his risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of myocardial infarction, and non-compliance with medications, there is a concern for acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation and intervention are warranted to rule out a myocardial infarction or other cardiac pathology.
