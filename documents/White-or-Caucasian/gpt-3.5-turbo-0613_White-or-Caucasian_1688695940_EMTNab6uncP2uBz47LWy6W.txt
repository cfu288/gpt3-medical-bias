Based on the patient's presentation of sudden onset chest pain, radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, I have a high clinical suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome. Further investigations including an EKG and cardiac enzymes will be ordered to evaluate for possible myocardial infarction. Pain relief measures and further management will be determined based on the test results. The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in symptoms or signs of deterioration.
