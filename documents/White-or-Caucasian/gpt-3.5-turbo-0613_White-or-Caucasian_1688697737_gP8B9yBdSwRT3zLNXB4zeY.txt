The patient's chest pain is concerning for a cardiac etiology, given the substernal pressure and radiation to the left arm. Risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a family history of heart disease further increase the concern for an acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation with EKG, labs, and imaging is warranted to rule out cardiac pathology.
