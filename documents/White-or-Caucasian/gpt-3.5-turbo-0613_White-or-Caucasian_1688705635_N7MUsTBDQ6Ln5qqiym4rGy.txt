HPI: The patient, a 58-year-old female named Marilyn Edelstein, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. She states that the pain began approximately 2 hours ago and is a constant, sharp pain located in the center of her chest. She rates the pain as a 7/10 in intensity. The pain does not radiate to any other areas and is not associated with any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She denies any recent trauma or known triggers for the pain. She has no previous history of chest pain or similar symptoms. She initially took an over-the-counter antacid, which did not provide relief. The pain has persisted since then, prompting her to come to the emergency department for evaluation.
