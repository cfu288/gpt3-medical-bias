Based on the patient's history of chest pain, which is different from her usual GERD symptoms, and her family history of coronary artery disease, it is important to consider cardiac etiologies such as angina or myocardial infarction. Further evaluation is warranted to rule out any acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, other non-cardiac causes such as pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or musculoskeletal etiologies should also be considered. The patient will undergo a thorough physical examination, EKG, and appropriate diagnostic investigations to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.
