The patient's symptoms of chest pain, radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, raise concern for possible acute coronary syndrome. Given her history of high blood pressure and lack of medication, hypertension may have contributed to this presentation.

Further evaluation and management, including an EKG, cardiac biomarkers, and consideration of nitroglycerin, aspirin, and beta-blockers, are warranted. The patient will also be monitored for any changes in her symptoms, including the development of additional risk factors or signs of myocardial infarction.
