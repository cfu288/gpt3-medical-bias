Based on the patient's history and presenting symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, further evaluation for possible myocardial infarction should be pursued. We will order an EKG, troponin levels, and a chest X-ray. Pain management will be addressed with appropriate medications as needed. Further assessment and management will depend on the results of these investigations.
