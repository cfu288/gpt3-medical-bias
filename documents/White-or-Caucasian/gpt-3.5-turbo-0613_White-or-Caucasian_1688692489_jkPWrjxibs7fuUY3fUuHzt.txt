The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw are concerning for possible cardiac etiology. Given his history of hypertension and family history of myocardial infarction, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential diagnosis. Further evaluation including an ECG and cardiac enzymes will be performed. In addition, the patient will be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and given aspirin as initial management for possible acute coronary syndrome.
