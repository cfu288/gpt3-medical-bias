Given the patient's age, sudden onset chest pain, and associated radiation to the left arm, a cardiac etiology such as acute coronary syndrome needs to be considered. A thorough physical examination and further workup, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, will be necessary to evaluate for possible myocardial infarction. Appropriate pain management and monitoring will be initiated.
