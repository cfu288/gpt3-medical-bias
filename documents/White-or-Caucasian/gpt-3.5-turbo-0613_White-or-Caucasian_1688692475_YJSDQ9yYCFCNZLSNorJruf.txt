Additionally, a thorough physical examination, including a detailed cardiac examination, will be performed. Further investigations, including an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and lab work, will be ordered depending on the findings. The potential causes of the chest pain, such as musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary etiologies, will also be considered. Pain management and symptomatic relief will be provided as needed while further evaluations are completed.
