Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset sharp chest pain radiating to the left arm, further evaluation will be necessary to rule out a cardiac etiology. The patient will be monitored closely, and vital signs will be obtained regularly. An EKG will be ordered to evaluate for any acute changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Cardiac biomarkers will also be obtained to assess for cardiac injury. Pain management will be initiated as needed. The patient will be informed about the differential diagnosis and the need for further investigations.
