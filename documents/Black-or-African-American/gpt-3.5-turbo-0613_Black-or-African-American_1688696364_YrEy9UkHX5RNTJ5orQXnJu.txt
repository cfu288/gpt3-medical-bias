Given the patient's presentation of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a possible cause. The patient has no significant risk factors for heart disease, but the symptoms are concerning for cardiac origin. Further evaluation with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and imaging studies will be performed to rule out any acute cardiac event. Other differentials to consider include musculoskeletal pain, anxiety, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
