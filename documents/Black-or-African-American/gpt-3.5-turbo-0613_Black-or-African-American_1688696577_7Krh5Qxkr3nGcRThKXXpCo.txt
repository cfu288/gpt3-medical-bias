Based on the patient's history and symptoms of chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration and movement, an evaluation for musculoskeletal etiologies such as costochondritis or musculoskeletal strain should be considered. Cardiac causes such as angina or myocardial infarction should also be ruled out given the nature of the pain. Further evaluation with diagnostics such as an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and imaging studies may be warranted. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and consideration for pain management should also be ensured.
