The patient's presenting symptoms of sudden-onset chest pain associated with shortness of breath and radiation to the left arm are concerning for a cardiac etiology, particularly acute coronary syndrome. Given his past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction, the patient is at increased risk for cardiac events. Further evaluation and management are indicated to rule out acute myocardial infarction and other potentially life-threatening causes.
