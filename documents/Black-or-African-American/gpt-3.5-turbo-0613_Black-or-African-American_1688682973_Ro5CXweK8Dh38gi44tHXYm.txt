Initial EKG and cardiac enzymes were ordered. The patient was placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and started on oxygen via nasal cannula. Intravenous access was established. The patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin, which provided partial relief of her chest pain. A stat chest X-ray was ordered to rule out other causes of chest pain. Cardiology was consulted, and the decision was made to admit the patient for further evaluation and management of a suspected acute coronary syndrome. Daily troponin levels will be obtained, and a stress test will be scheduled prior to discharge.

The patient was educated about the importance of following up with cardiology, adhering to her medications, maintaining a heart-healthy diet, and reducing modifiable risk factors such as smoking and sedentary lifestyle. She was advised to seek medical attention promptly if her symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop. Discharge planning has been initiated, and the patient is awaiting a bed assignment.
