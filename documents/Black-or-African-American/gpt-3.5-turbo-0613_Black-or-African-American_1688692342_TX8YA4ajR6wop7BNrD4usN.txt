Given the patient's presentation of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and sweating, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as the primary differential diagnosis. Cardiac etiologies such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina should be ruled out. Other differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, and musculoskeletal causes. Further evaluation including ECG, cardiac enzymes, and possibly imaging studies will be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis. The patient will be closely monitored and further management will be determined based on the assessment findings.
