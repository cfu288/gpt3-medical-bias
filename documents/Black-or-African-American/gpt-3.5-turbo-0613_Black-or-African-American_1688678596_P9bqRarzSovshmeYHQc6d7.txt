Based on the patient's presenting symptoms of sudden-onset chest pain at rest radiating to the left arm and jaw, along with associated shortness of breath and diaphoresis, there is concern for an acute coronary syndrome. This is especially important given the patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease including age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and positive family history. The patient will be further evaluated and managed accordingly.
