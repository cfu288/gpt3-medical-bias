HPI: The patient is a 56-year-old female with a chief complaint of chest pain. She reports that the pain started suddenly approximately two hours ago while she was at home. The pain is substernal, pressure-like in nature, and radiates to her left arm. She rates the pain as 8/10 in intensity. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or nausea. She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and is not currently taking any medications for these conditions.

PMHx: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She reports that her blood pressure is usually well-controlled with lifestyle modifications, though she does not take any medications for it. Her diabetes is managed with diet and exercise alone.

PSurgHx: No past surgical history.

FamHx: The patient reports a family history of hypertension in her father. No history of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes in her immediate family.

SocHx: The patient is a retired school teacher. She denies any tobacco use but admits to consuming alcohol occasionally. She lives with her spouse and has a supportive social network.

Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset substernal chest pain, radiating to the left arm, in the context of her risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension and diabetes), it is imperative to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential cause. Further evaluation and diagnostic workup, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and possible stress testing, should be pursued. Additionally, attention should be given to the possibility of other non-cardiac causes of chest pain, such as musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal etiologies. A focused physical examination, including a thorough cardiovascular examination, will also be necessary to further guide the next steps in management for this patient.
