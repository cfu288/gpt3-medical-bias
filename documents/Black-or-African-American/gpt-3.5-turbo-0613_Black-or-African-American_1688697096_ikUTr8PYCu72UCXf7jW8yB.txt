Based on the patient's history, the presenting complaint of sudden-onset and sharp chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration, and the absence of associated symptoms such as shortness of breath or diaphoresis, a possible diagnosis of pleuritic chest pain is considered. Additional investigations, including an electrocardiogram and chest x-ray, will be ordered to rule out other causes of chest pain, such as acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism. Pain management and further interventions will be determined based on the results of these investigations.
