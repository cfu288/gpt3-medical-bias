A cardiac workup including an EKG and cardiac enzymes should be obtained to evaluate for cardiac causes of the chest pain. Additionally, a chest x-ray and a D-dimer test can be considered to evaluate for other possible causes such as pulmonary embolism. If the pain persists, further imaging such as a CT angiography may be indicated. Pain management and close monitoring of vital signs should also be initiated.
