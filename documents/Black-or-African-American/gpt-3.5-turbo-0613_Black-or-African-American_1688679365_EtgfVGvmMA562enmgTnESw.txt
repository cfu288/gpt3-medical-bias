Note: The patient's presentation of chest pain, radiating down the left arm, and associated anxiety raises concerns for possible acute coronary syndrome. This necessitates further evaluation with a focused physical examination, ECG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray. Additionally, patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, non-compliance with medications, and family history of myocardial infarction further heightens the suspicion for cardiac pathology.
