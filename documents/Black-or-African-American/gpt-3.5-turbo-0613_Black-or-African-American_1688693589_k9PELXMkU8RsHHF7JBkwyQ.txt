Based on the patient's history of chest pain, radiating to the left arm and associated with shortness of breath and sweating, a cardiac etiology should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient's past medical history of hypertension and family history of myocardial infarction further increase suspicion for a cardiac event. Additional evaluation and workup including EKG, cardiac enzymes, and further imaging studies are warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome.
