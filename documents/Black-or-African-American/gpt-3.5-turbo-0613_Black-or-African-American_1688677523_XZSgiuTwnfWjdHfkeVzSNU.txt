Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset severe chest pain with radiation to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and sweating, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension and hyperlipidemia), there is a concern for acute coronary syndrome. The patient will need further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB, troponin), and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram or stress test) to assess for a possible myocardial infarction. Immediate management will include supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, aspirin administration, and pain control.

At this time, the patient is stable and awaiting further evaluation.
