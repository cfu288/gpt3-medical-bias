Further evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests will be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. A cardiovascular examination, EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray will be ordered. Pain management and supportive measures will also be provided while awaiting results. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in her symptoms or vital signs. Consultation with cardiology will be considered depending on the diagnostic findings.
