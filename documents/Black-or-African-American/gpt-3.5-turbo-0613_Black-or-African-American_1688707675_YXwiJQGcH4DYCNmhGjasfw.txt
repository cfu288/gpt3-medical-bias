Further evaluation and diagnostic tests will be ordered to assess the underlying cause of the patient's chest pain and to rule out any cardiac etiology. The plan includes obtaining cardiac enzymes, a chest X-ray, and an echocardiogram. Additionally, the patient will receive aspirin, nitroglycerin, and pain medication as needed for symptomatic relief. The patient will be closely monitored and further interventions will be determined based on the findings of her diagnostic workup.
