Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain, radiating pain to the left arm, and lack of relief with antacids, the presence of risk factors such as male gender and age, and the absence of other symptoms such as shortness of breath or diaphoresis, a thorough evaluation for acute coronary syndrome is warranted. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray. Pain management and cardiac monitoring will be initiated while awaiting further evaluation.
