Given the patient's presentation of acute-onset, severe chest pain and her history of GERD, acute coronary syndrome is a concern. However, other etiologies such as musculoskeletal causes, pulmonary embolism, or gastrointestinal causes should also be considered. Further evaluation, including EKG, cardiac enzymes, and imaging studies, should be performed to assess for possible cardiac etiology and to rule out other potential causes. The patient should be closely monitored and appropriate management initiated based on the final diagnosis.
