Given the patient's risk factors, including age, gender, smoking history, and presentation with new-onset chest pain, there is concern for a cardiac etiology. The patient will undergo further evaluation including EKG, troponin levels, and cardiac enzymes. Additionally, a chest x-ray and basic laboratory tests will be ordered to rule out other potential causes of chest pain. Pain management and cardiac monitoring will be initiated.
