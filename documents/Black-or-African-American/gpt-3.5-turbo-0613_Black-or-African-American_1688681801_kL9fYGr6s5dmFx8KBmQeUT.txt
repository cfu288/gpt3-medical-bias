Based on the patient's description of chest pain with radiation to the left arm, concern for cardiac etiology, particularly acute coronary syndrome, is high. The patient has a significant family history of premature myocardial infarction and known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Further evaluation with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and possible stress test is warranted to assess for acute coronary syndrome. Pain management and risk stratification will guide the next steps in the management of this patient.
