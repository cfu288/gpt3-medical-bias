Given the patient's presentation of acute, severe chest pain with associated shortness of breath and diaphoresis, the concern for cardiac etiology, most notably an acute coronary syndrome, is high. The patient will be further evaluated with appropriate diagnostic tests, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray, to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms. Treatment and management will be tailored based on the findings of further evaluation.
