HPI: The patient, a 62-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. She reports that the pain started suddenly about 2 hours ago while she was at home. The pain is located in the center of her chest and radiates to her left arm. She describes the pain as pressure-like and rates it as a 7 out of 10 in severity. She has tried taking over-the-counter antacids but did not experience any relief. The pain is not aggravated by movement or breathing. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness.

PMHx: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She reports being on medications for these conditions but is unable to recall the specific names.

Medications: The patient is taking unspecified medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

PSurgHx: The patient denies any previous surgeries.

FamHx: The patient's family history is significant for coronary artery disease in her father who had a myocardial infarction at the age of 65.

SocHx: The patient is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.

Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain that radiates to the left arm and is not relieved by antacids, further evaluation is warranted to rule out a cardiac etiology. The patient's past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes also increase the suspicion for a cardiac cause.
