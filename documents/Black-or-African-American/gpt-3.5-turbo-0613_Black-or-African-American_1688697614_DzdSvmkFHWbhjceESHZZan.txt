The patient's chest pain is concerning for possible cardiac etiology, given the sharp, stabbing nature of the pain and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea. Given her age and family history, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a concern. Initial evaluation will include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac enzymes. The patient will be monitored closely with continuous cardiac monitoring. Oxygen will be administered, and a nitroglycerin tablet will be given sublingually for pain relief. A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel will be obtained to evaluate for other possible causes of chest pain. The patient will be kept NPO in the meantime in case further diagnostic tests are warranted, such as a stress test or cardiac catheterization. Pain management and reassurance will also be provided to the patient.
