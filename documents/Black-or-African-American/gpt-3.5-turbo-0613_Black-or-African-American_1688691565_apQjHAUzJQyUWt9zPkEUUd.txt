Based on the patient's presenting symptoms of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm, associated shortness of breath and diaphoresis, and the absence of known risk factors for angina or heart disease, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential diagnosis. Further evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests such as an electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers will be performed to determine the cause of the patient's chest pain. The patient will be closely monitored, and pain management will be provided as needed.
