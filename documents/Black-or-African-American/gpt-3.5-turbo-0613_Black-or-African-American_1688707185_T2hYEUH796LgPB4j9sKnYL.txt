Given the patient's age, risk factors for heart disease, and the nature of her chest pain radiating to her arm and associated with shortness of breath, it is important to rule out a cardiac etiology for her symptoms. The patient will undergo further evaluation including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray. Additional interventions and consultations may be required based on the results.
