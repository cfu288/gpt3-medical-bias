Based on the patient's chest pain radiating to her left arm and the absence of associated symptoms such as shortness of breath or diaphoresis, a cardiac etiology such as angina or myocardial infarction should be considered. Further evaluation will include an EKG, cardiac enzyme assessment, and chest X-ray. Pain management and antiplatelet therapy will be initiated as appropriate. The patient will also receive counseling on risk factor modification, including smoking cessation and lifestyle changes to improve blood pressure and cholesterol control. The cardiology service will be consulted for further evaluation and management.
