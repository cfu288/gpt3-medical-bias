I have obtained history from the patient who presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently taking metoprolol succinate, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, metformin, and aspirin. The patient has a family history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. The patient is a smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. Further evaluation and workup are required to determine the etiology of the patient's chest pain.
