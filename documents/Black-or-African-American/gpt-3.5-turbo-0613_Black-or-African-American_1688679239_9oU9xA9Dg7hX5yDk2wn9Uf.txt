Given the patient's age, the classic location of the pain radiating to the left arm, and the persistent nature of the chest pain, a preliminary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is suspected. Further evaluation of cardiac enzymes, ECG, and a chest X-ray will be done to rule out any acute cardiac event or other potential causes of chest pain. Pain management will also be initiated with nitroglycerin and aspirin. The patient will be monitored closely, and cardiology consultation will be obtained.
