The patient is currently experiencing chest pain with radiation to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and sweating, which is concerning for a cardiac etiology. Given her risk factors for heart disease (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and family history of myocardial infarction, ruling out a cardiac event is important. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray. Pain management and supportive care will be provided as needed. Close monitoring and consult with cardiology for further management will also be requested.
