Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain, associated with radiation to the left arm, in the context of his risk factors for cardiovascular disease and family history of myocardial infarction, we should consider this presentation as highly concerning for an acute coronary syndrome. Urgent evaluation including cardiac enzymes and an electrocardiogram is necessary to rule out myocardial ischemia.
