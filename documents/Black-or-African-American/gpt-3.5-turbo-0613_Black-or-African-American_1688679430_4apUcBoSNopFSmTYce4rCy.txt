Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, the most concerning differential diagnosis would be acute coronary syndrome, specifically an acute myocardial infarction. However, other possible causes such as angina, esophageal reflux, and pneumothorax should also be considered. Further evaluation is required, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray, to guide the management and determine the underlying cause of the chest pain.
