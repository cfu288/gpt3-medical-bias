Patient appears to be in mild distress due to chest pain. Vital signs stable. Plan to perform an EKG, troponin level, and obtain a chest x-ray.

Pain relief with nitroglycerin will be attempted if chest pain persists. Reassess patient after initial diagnostic studies and determine the need for further interventions or consults.
