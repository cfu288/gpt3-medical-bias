Based on the patient's presentation of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and previous history of MI, it is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome. Immediate evaluation and intervention are required to rule out unstable angina or myocardial infarction. The patient has been placed on continuous cardiac monitoring, and blood samples have been drawn for cardiac enzymes and troponin levels. An EKG has been ordered to assess for possible ST-segment changes. The patient has received aspirin, oxygen, and nitroglycerin as per protocol. Further testing and consultation with the cardiology team will be necessary.
