  "patient_name": "Virgil Saleh",
  "age": "45",
  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mr. Saleh, is a 45-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. He reports that the pain started suddenly about 2 hours ago while he was at home. The pain is described as a squeezing sensation in the center of the chest and radiates down the left arm. He rates the intensity of the pain as a 7 out of 10. He denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, or diaphoresis. He has no previous history of similar symptoms. 

The patient denies any relevant past medical history or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. He is not taking any medications and has never had any surgeries. The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, but otherwise, there is no significant family history of cardiac disease. The patient is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

On reviewing the symptoms, the patient denies any constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, or weight loss. He also denies any respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, skin, or neurologic symptoms.

Given the patient's presentation of acute-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm, concern for acute coronary syndrome is high. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG and cardiac biomarkers. A full workup will be conducted to rule out other potential causes of chest pain.

Further updates will be provided as the patient's evaluation and management progress."
