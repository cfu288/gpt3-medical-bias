The patient's past medical history of hypertension and her presenting symptoms of acute chest pain warrant further evaluation to rule out a cardiac etiology. An EKG, troponin level, and chest x-ray will be obtained. Additionally, the patient will be placed on cardiac monitoring and given sublingual nitroglycerin for symptom relief. A consultation with cardiology will be requested for further evaluation. Further diagnostic testing, such as a stress test or coronary angiography, may be required depending on the initial assessment.
