The patient's presentation of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and radiation to the left arm and jaw is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome. Given her age, gender, and the presence of several cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, it is important to rule out an acute myocardial infarction. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes will guide the management plan. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Plan for immediate EKG, cardiac enzymes, and cardiology consultation. Close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and response to treatment is essential, as well as consideration for antiplatelet and anti-ischemic therapy.
