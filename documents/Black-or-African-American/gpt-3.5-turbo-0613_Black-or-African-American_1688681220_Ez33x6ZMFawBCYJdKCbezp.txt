The patient's demographics, presenting complaint, and medical history are consistent with a possible cardiac etiology for the chest pain. However, further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes, are warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Differential diagnoses to consider include acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and musculoskeletal chest pain. The patient will be closely monitored, and further investigations will be ordered to guide the management plan.
