  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation in the center of her chest. The pain started suddenly about 30 minutes ago and has not subsided. She rates the pain as a 7 out of 10 in intensity. The pain is not relieved by rest or change in position. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or diaphoresis. The patient has no prior history of chest pain or heart disease. She denies any recent trauma or injury. 

On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung examination is clear bilaterally. No abnormal findings are noted on the rest of the physical examination.

Given the patient's chief complaint of chest pain and the possibility of acute coronary syndrome, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which revealed ST-segment depression in leads V2-V6. Based on these findings, the patient was started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy and an urgent cardiology consultation was requested for further evaluation and management."
