Based on the patient's history and presenting symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, associated with shortness of breath and lightheadedness, there is concern for a possible cardiac etiology.

Further evaluation including cardiac biomarkers, EKG, and imaging studies will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
