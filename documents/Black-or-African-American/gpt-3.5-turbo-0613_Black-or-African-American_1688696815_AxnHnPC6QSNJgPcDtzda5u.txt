Based on the patient's symptoms of chest pain, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome is of concern. The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a positive family history. The plan is to obtain an EKG and cardiac enzyme levels to evaluate for evidence of myocardial infarction. In the meantime, the patient will be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and receive supplemental oxygen. Pain control will be provided with nitroglycerin and morphine as needed.
