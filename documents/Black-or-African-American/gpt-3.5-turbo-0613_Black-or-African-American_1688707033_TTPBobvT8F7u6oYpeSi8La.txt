PMHx: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She is currently on amlodipine and atorvastatin.

Based on the patient's history of chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, she is at risk for a cardiac etiology. Given her risk factors of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and family history of myocardial infarction, it is important to rule out acute coronary syndrome. A focused physical examination, electrocardiogram, and cardiac biomarkers will be performed to further evaluate her.
