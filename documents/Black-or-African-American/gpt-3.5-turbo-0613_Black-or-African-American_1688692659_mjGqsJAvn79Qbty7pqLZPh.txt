Given the patient's chief complaint of chest pain, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential cause. Other differentials to consider include musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia increases her risk for cardiac disease. Further evaluation and investigation, including an ECG and cardiac enzymes, are warranted to rule out myocardial infarction. Pain management and appropriate referrals will be determined based on the results of these evaluations.
