The patient's [age of 54] and [sudden onset of sharp, stabbing chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and sweating] raise concerns for acute coronary syndrome. Differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and other cardiac causes such as pericarditis. Further evaluation with physical examination, EKG, cardiac enzymes, and possibly cardiac imaging will be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. Treatment will be based on the underlying diagnosis.
