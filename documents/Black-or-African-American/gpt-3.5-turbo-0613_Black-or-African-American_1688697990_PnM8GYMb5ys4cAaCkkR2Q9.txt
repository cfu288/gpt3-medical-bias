Given the patient's age, gender, and presenting symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, there is concern for an acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation and workup, including an EKG, troponin levels, and possible cardiac catheterization, will be necessary to rule out a myocardial infarction. Additionally, the patient's hypertension should be addressed and managed appropriately.
