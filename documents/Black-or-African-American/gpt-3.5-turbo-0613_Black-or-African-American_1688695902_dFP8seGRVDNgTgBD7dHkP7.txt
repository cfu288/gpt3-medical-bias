Based on the patient's history and presenting symptoms, a thorough cardiac evaluation will be initiated, which may include EKG, cardiac enzymes, and further diagnostic testing as indicated. Chest pain can have various cardiac and non-cardiac etiologies, and ruling out any acute coronary syndrome is of utmost importance. Additionally, consideration will be given to other potential causes of chest pain, such as pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, or musculoskeletal strain. The patient will also be monitored for any hemodynamic instability or changes in pain severity. A consultation with the cardiology service may be obtained for further evaluation and management.
