Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential etiology. Other differentials such as musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pulmonary embolism should also be considered. Further evaluation including an EKG, troponin level, and chest x-ray will be ordered to assess for acute coronary syndrome and rule out other potential causes. The patient will be placed on cardiac monitoring and given a sublingual nitroglycerin for symptomatic relief until further evaluation.
