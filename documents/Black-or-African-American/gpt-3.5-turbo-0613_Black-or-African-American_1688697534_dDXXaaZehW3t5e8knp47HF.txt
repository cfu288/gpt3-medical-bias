Given the patient's presentation of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm and risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a positive family history of heart disease, it is important to consider the possibility of acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a thorough physical examination is warranted. Pain control and monitoring will be ensured while awaiting further test results.
