Given the patient's age, risk factors, and presenting symptoms of crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm with associated shortness of breath and lightheadedness, acute coronary syndrome should be high on the differential. Other differentials to consider include gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal chest pain, and anxiety. Further evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests such as an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray will help in determining the cause of her symptoms.
