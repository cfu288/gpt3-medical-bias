The patient's symptoms, including the location and radiation of the chest pain, as well as associated diaphoresis and shortness of breath, are concerning for a possible myocardial infarction. Given the patient's risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and positive family history of myocardial infarction, the working diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG, laboratory tests including troponin, and medical management will be initiated.
