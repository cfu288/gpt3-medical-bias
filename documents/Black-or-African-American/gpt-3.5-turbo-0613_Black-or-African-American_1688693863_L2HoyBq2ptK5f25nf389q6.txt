Based on the patient's history of chest pain, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and noncompliance with medications for hypertension and diabetes, urgent evaluation for a possible cardiac etiology, such as acute coronary syndrome, is warranted. Further investigations including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and possibly a stress test may be necessary to rule out myocardial infarction. The patient should be closely monitored and appropriate interventions initiated as needed. Consultation with cardiology is advised.
