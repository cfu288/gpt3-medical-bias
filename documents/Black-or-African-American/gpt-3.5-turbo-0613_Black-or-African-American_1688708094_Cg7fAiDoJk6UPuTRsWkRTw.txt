Based on the patient's history of abrupt-onset, moderate-intensity chest pain without any associated symptoms or known precipitating factors, further evaluation is warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. The patient's past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia further raises concerns for underlying cardiovascular disease. An EKG and cardiac enzyme levels will be obtained, and the patient will be monitored in the emergency department. Additionally, a thorough physical examination will be performed to assess for any findings that may suggest an alternative etiology for the chest pain. The patient's pain will be managed appropriately, and further diagnostic testing or consultations will be considered based on the initial evaluation.
