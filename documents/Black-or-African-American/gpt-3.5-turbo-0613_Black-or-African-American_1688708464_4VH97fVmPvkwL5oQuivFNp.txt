Given the patient's age, presentation, and risk factors, ruling out a cardiac etiology of the chest pain is of utmost importance. Possible differentials to consider include acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, and musculoskeletal chest pain. Further evaluations, including electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and imaging studies, will be ordered to provide a more definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.
