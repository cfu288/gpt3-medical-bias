Based on the patient's presenting complaint and history, the possibility of a cardiac etiology for the chest pain should be considered. Further evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, will be necessary to rule out acute myocardial infarction. Other potential causes of chest pain such as musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary etiologies should also be explored. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she appears comfortable at the moment, but close monitoring and further assessments should be conducted to ensure her condition does not deteriorate.
