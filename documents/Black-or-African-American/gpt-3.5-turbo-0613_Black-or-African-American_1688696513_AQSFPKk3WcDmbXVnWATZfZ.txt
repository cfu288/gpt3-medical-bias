Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain, located in the center of the chest and worsened with deep inspiration, further evaluation is warranted to rule out potential cardiac causes. My differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and musculoskeletal causes. Further assessment with laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and possibly imaging studies will aid in determining the cause of the patient's symptoms. [Consultation with cardiology and pulmonary medicine will be considered if necessary.]
