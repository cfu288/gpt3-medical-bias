Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm and the absence of typical cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath or diaphoresis, a differential diagnosis may include musculoskeletal chest pain, pleuritic chest pain, or a possible cardiac event. Further evaluation with a physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies will be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.
