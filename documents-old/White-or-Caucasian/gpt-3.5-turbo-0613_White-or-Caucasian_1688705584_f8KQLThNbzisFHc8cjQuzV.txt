He rates the intensity of the pain as 8/10 and describes it as being pressure-like in nature. The patient denies any alleviating or aggravating factors. He also reports associated symptoms of shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He has no previous history of chest pain or cardiac issues.

PMHx: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, for which he takes Losartan. He has no other known medical conditions, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or heart disease.

FamHx: The patient reports no significant family history of heart disease or other relevant medical conditions.

The patient's chest pain, along with the associated symptoms of shortness of breath and diaphoresis, is concerning for a cardiac etiology. Given his risk factors such as hypertension and sedentary lifestyle, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and myocardial infarction (MI) should be considered. Further evaluation is needed, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes, to rule out cardiac ischemia and determine the appropriate management plan.
