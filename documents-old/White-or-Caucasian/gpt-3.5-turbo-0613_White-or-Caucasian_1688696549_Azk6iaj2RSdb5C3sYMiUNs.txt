The history of present illness is concerning for possible cardiac etiology given the sudden onset of chest pain, characteristic squeezing sensation, and lack of relief with rest. Other symptoms associated with acute coronary syndrome, such as shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and radiation of pain, are notably absent. The patient's medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are both risk factors for coronary artery disease. Family history is also notable for coronary artery disease in the father. Further evaluation with an EKG, troponin level, and cardiac enzymes is warranted to rule out acute myocardial infarction.
