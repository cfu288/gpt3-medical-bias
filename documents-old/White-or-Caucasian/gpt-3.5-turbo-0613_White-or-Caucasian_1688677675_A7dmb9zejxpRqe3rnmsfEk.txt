Based on the patient's presentation of sudden onset crushing substernal pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, a preliminary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, specifically an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), must be considered. Urgent evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent further cardiac damage and reduce mortality. The patient should be immediately assessed for vital signs, EKG, cardiac enzymes, and oxygen saturation.
