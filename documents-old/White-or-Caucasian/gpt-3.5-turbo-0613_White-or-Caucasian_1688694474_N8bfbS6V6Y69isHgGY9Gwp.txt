Given the presenting complaint of chest pain, further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause. The patient's age, risk factors, and symptoms raise concern for a cardiac etiology, such as angina or acute coronary syndrome. However, other causes such as musculoskeletal chest pain or gastrointestinal issues cannot be entirely excluded without further evaluation. A comprehensive physical examination, including a detailed cardiac examination, will be performed. Relevant investigations, such as an electrocardiogram, troponin levels, and imaging studies, will be ordered to aid in the diagnosis and guide management. Pain management and appropriate monitoring will be initiated while awaiting results. Close observation and timely reassessment will be crucial in determining the patient's clinical course and potential need for further interventions.
