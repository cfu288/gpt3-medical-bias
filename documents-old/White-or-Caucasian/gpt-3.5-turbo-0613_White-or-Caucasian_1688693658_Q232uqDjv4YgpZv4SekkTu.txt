HPI: The patient, a 42-year-old male named Lucian Young, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain started suddenly approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of his chest. He rates the pain as a 7/10 in intensity and says it is worsened with deep breaths and movement. The pain has not radiated to any other area and is not associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or palpitations. The patient denies any recent trauma or strenuous physical activity that could have triggered the pain. No alleviating factors have been identified.

Medications: The patient takes metoprolol and atorvastatin for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia respectively. He also uses nicotine patches as part of his tobacco cessation treatment.
PSurgHx: The patient denies any past surgical procedures.
FamHx: The patient's family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father, who experienced a heart attack in his early 50s. There is no history of other cardiovascular diseases or sudden cardiac death.
SocHx: The patient is married and works as an office manager. He is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history but has quit for the past 6 months. He denies any illicit drug use or excessive alcohol intake. He reports a sedentary lifestyle with minimal exercise.

Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain, associated with deep breaths and movement, and worsened by physical exertion, there is concern for a possible musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis. However, given the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the potential for atypical presentations, other causes, such as acute coronary syndrome, must be considered. Further evaluation will be performed to rule out cardiac causes of his chest pain.
