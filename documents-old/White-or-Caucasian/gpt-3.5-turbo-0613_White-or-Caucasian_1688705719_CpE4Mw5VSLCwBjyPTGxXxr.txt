Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset severe chest pain, associated shortness of breath, and sweating, a possible acute coronary syndrome such as myocardial infarction must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation and workup are warranted, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray. Pain control and cardiac monitoring should be initiated, and the patient should be admitted to a telemetry unit for further evaluation and management.
