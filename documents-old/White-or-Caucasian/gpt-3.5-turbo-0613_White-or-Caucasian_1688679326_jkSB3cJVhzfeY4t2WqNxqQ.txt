[Given the patient's symptoms of chest pain, radiating to the left arm, and her risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, it is important to rule out or confirm acute coronary syndrome. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia further increases her risk. Other differentials to consider include gastrointestinal causes such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or musculoskeletal causes such as costochondritis. A thorough physical examination, EKG, cardiac enzymes, and additional diagnostic tests may be warranted to establish a diagnosis and guide further management.]
