Physical Exam: 
- Vital signs: HR 86 bpm, BP 132/80 mmHg, RR 16 breaths/min, O2 saturation 99% on room air
- General: The patient appears in mild distress due to chest pain.
- HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. No scleral icterus.

Data interpretation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset central chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with pressure-like sensation, raises concern for cardiac etiology. Additional evaluation with EKG, troponin level, and further cardiac workup is indicated to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Other differentials to consider include musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pulmonary causes.
