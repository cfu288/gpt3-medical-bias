Based on the patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, these could be indicative of a cardiac event such as acute myocardial infarction. Further evaluation, including diagnostic tests such as an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
