Given the patient's age, risk factors, and the nature of his chest pain radiating to the left arm along with associated shortness of breath and sweating, myocardial infarction must be considered in the differential diagnosis. We will perform further evaluation, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes, to rule out an acute coronary event. Pain relief will be provided and the patient will be closely monitored.
