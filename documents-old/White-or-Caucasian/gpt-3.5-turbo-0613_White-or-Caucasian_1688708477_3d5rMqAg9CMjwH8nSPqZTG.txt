Upon assessing this patient, it is important to consider the possibility of acute coronary syndrome given his symptoms of chest pain, radiation to the left arm, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

Given his risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a positive family history of myocardial infarction, prompt intervention may be necessary.
