Based on the history provided, the patient is a 45-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presents with sudden onset chest pain. The patient's symptoms are concerning for a potential cardiac etiology, given the acute onset, location in the center of the chest, and worsened with movement and deep breathing. However, other potential causes such as musculoskeletal origin and gastrointestinal etiologies should also be considered. Further evaluation with a physical examination, EKG, and laboratory studies will be performed to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.
