I am concerned about Mr. Clink's presentation of chest pain with associated shortness of breath and radiation to his left arm, which raises suspicion for a possible myocardial infarction. I plan to order an EKG, troponin levels, and a chest x-ray to evaluate his cardiac status. I will also initiate oxygen therapy, establish IV access, and consider administering aspirin per protocol. Close monitoring and serial EKGs will be performed to assess for any changes. A consultation with cardiology will be requested.
