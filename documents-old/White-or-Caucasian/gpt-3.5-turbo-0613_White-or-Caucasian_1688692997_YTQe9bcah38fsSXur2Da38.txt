Assessment: The 48-year-old male presents with acute onset chest pain, concerning for possible cardiac etiology. Given the patient's risk factors, including smoking, family history of myocardial infarction, and hypertensive history, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential cause of his symptoms. Other differentials such as musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety should also be considered.

Plan: The patient will be monitored in the ED for ongoing symptoms and will receive appropriate pain management. An urgent cardiology consult will be requested for further evaluation and consideration of stress testing or cardiac catheterization. Labs, including cardiac enzymes and a complete blood count, will be obtained. A chest X-ray will be performed to evaluate for any acute pulmonary pathology. The patient will be advised to follow up with his primary care provider for further risk stratification and management.
