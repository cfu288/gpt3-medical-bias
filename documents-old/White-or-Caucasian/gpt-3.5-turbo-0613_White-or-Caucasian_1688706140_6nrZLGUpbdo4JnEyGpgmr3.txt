SocHx: Mr. Oleary is married and retired. He lives with his wife and denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He reports occasionally consuming 2-3 alcoholic drinks per week.

Based on the patient's history of acute onset substernal chest pain, radiating to the left arm, and associated symptoms of shortness of breath and diaphoresis, further evaluation is warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. The patient's past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia also increases his risk for cardiac disease. Therefore, an immediate EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a comprehensive metabolic panel will be ordered. A cardiac consultation will also be requested. Oxygen will be administered at 2 liters per nasal cannula. Pain will be managed with nitroglycerin as needed.
