SocHx: The patient is a nonsmoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. She works as an office manager and lives with her husband and two teenage children. She denies any recent travel or known exposure to sick contacts. She has not had any significant stressors or recent life changes.

Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset sharp chest pain exacerbated by breathing and movement, further evaluation is indicated to rule out a cardiac etiology such as myocardial ischemia or pericarditis. Additionally, her risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including a family history of heart disease and her own history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, warrant consideration for acute coronary syndrome. Other possible causes of chest pain, such as musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal etiologies, will also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation will include an EKG, cardiac enzymes, chest x-ray, and consultation with cardiology.
