Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm, associated shortness of breath and diaphoresis, and her risk factors including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, concern for acute coronary syndrome is high. Further evaluation with an EKG, troponin levels, and echocardiogram will be pursued. In the meantime, she will be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and given nitroglycerin sublingually for pain relief.
