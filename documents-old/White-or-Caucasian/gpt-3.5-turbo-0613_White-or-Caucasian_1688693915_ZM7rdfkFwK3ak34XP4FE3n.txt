Based on the patient's presentation of chest pain, radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, and associated diaphoresis, a differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction, must be considered. Immediate EKG monitoring and cardiac enzyme testing are indicated. Further evaluation will include a comprehensive cardiovascular examination and further diagnostic studies, as deemed necessary. Pain management and close monitoring for hemodynamic stability are also priorities. Close consultation with the cardiology team will be sought for further evaluation and management of the patient.
