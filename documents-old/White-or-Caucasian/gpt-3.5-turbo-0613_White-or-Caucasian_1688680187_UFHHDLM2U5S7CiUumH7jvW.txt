Given the patient's presenting symptoms of sudden onset chest pain, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) such as myocardial infarction should be considered. A thorough evaluation including an EKG, cardiac biomarkers, and further imaging studies will be initiated to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. The patient's risk factors, including his age, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and hypertension, are concerning for cardiac disease. Pain management and antiplatelet therapy will be considered as appropriate. The patient will be closely monitored in the emergency department, and a cardiology consult will be initiated for further evaluation and management.
