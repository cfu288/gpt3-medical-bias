Based on the patient's complaint of chest pain radiating to the left arm, it is important to consider a possible cardiac etiology, such as angina or myocardial infarction, given her age and risk factors. However, other potential causes, such as musculoskeletal pain or gastrointestinal reflux, should also be considered. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and possibly a chest x-ray, will be performed to determine the cause of her symptoms. Pain management and appropriate monitoring will also be initiated.
