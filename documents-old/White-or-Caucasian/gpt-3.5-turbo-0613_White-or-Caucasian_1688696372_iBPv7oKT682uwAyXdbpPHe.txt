Patient Name: Lucille Adams 
Age: [64]

CC: Chest Pain
HPI: The patient, a 64-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a complaint of chest pain. She reports that the pain started abruptly about 2 hours ago and is located in the central part of her chest. She describes the pain as a squeezing sensation that radiates to her left arm. She states that the pain is associated with shortness of breath and sweating. The patient denies any recent illness or injury preceding the onset of the chest pain. She denies any palpitations, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness. She also denies any nausea or vomiting. The patient states that she has never experienced this type of pain before and is concerned about a heart attack.

ROS:
- General: The patient reports feeling generally unwell and fatigued in the past couple of days. She denies any fevers, chills, or unintentional weight changes.
- Head: Negative for any headache, blurry vision, or dizziness.
- Eyes: No visual changes or eye pain.
- Cardiovascular: Aside from the chest pain, the patient denies any palpitations, irregular heartbeats, or previous history of heart problems.
- Pulm: No cough, shortness of breath at rest, or wheezing.
- GI: The patient denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel movements.

PMHx: The patient has a medical history of hypertension, for which she has been on amlodipine for the past 5 years. She also has a history of dyslipidemia and is taking atorvastatin.

Medications: 
1. Amlodipine 5 mg daily for hypertension.
2. Atorvastatin 20 mg daily for dyslipidemia.

PSurgHx: The patient denies any previous surgeries.

FamHx: Positive for a family history of hypertension and heart disease. Her father had a heart attack in his 70s.

SocHx: The patient is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. She lives with her husband, who is supportive. She is currently retired.

Based on her presentation, the patient's chest pain, associated symptoms, and risk factors for heart disease, I am concerned about a cardiac etiology for her symptoms, including angina or a heart attack. Other possible differentials to consider in this case include musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal reflux disease, and anxiety. Further evaluation and diagnostic workup are warranted to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and the appropriate management plan.
