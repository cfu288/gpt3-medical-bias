The patient's presentation of chest pain, radiating to the left arm and jaw, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, is concerning for possible acute coronary syndrome. Given his risk factors of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and positive family history of myocardial infarction, it is important to rapidly assess and rule out an acute myocardial infarction. EKG and cardiac biomarkers will be ordered and the patient will be monitored closely for any changes in his clinical condition. Immediate notification of the cardiologist will also be made for further management.
