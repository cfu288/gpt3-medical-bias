Based on the patient's history of sudden onset of sharp, stabbing chest pain without radiation, associated symptoms, or risk factors for ischemic heart disease, further evaluation is warranted to rule out potential causes of chest pain such as musculoskeletal strain, anxiety-related chest pain, or other non-cardiac etiologies. The patient will undergo a thorough physical examination, including a cardiovascular examination, as well as an EKG and laboratory tests to assess cardiac markers. A discussion regarding the management of stress and strategies for stress reduction will also be initiated. Further diagnostic testing or consultation with a cardiologist may be necessary depending on the initial evaluation findings.
