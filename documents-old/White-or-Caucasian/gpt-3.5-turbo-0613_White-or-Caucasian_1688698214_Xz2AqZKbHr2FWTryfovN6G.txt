Given the patient's acute-onset, sharp and stabbing central chest pain that worsens with deep breaths and movement, it is important to consider various differential diagnoses. These may include musculoskeletal pain, pleuritis, pulmonary embolism, or other cardiac causes. A detailed cardiac workup including an EKG, chest x-ray, and cardiac enzymes will be performed to rule out any potentially serious cardiac conditions. Close monitoring of vital signs and adequate pain control will be initiated. The patient will also be advised to follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation and any necessary cardiology referral if no significant abnormalities are found.
