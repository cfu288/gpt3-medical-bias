Based on the patient's history of chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath, and fatigue, there is concern for a cardiac etiology, specifically ischemic heart disease. Other differentials such as GERD, musculoskeletal, and respiratory causes will be considered. Further evaluation will be conducted, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray. Pain management and appropriate interventions will be implemented based on the patient's condition and test results.
