Based on the patient's history of chest pain, radiation to the neck and left arm, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath and diaphoresis, there is a concern for a possible acute coronary syndrome. The patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and family history, further increase the suspicion. The patient will be further evaluated and appropriate diagnostic tests will be ordered.
