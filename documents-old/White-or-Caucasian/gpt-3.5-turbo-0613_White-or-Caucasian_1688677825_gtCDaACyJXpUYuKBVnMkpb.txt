Based on the patient's history, presentation, and associated symptoms, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Immediate intervention and further evaluation, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes, will be required to rule out myocardial infarction. Pain management and monitoring will be essential during evaluation and treatment.

The patient will be placed on a cardiac monitor, and supplemental oxygen will be administered at [2 L/min]. An IV line will be established for medication administration and fluid resuscitation as needed. Cardiology consultation will be requested for further management and consideration for cardiac catheterization if indicated.

Patient and family education will be provided on lifestyle modifications, such as a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and medication adherence, to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.

Disposition depends on the patient's response to treatment and further diagnostic evaluation.
