The patient's symptoms of chest pain, radiating to the left arm and jaw, raise concerns for a possible cardiac etiology. Given her risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a family history of heart disease, myocardial infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Other possibilities to consider include musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary causes of chest pain. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray, will be ordered to help guide the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.
