Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a positive family history of myocardial infarction, further evaluation is warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. The patient is currently stable, and initial workup will include an EKG, troponin level, and a chest X-ray. Pain management will be provided and the patient will be closely monitored for any changes in symptoms while awaiting the results.
