The patient's chief complaint of chest pain, along with the associated symptoms of shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, raises concerns for a cardiac etiology. Given his age, risk factors, and family history of cardiac disease, acute coronary syndrome needs to be considered. Further evaluation with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest radiograph will be warranted. Additionally, it is important to rule out other potential causes of chest pain such as musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary etiologies.
