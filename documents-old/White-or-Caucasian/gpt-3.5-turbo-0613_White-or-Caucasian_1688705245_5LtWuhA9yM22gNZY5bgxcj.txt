Chest pain in a 42-year-old patient with risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, stress, and family history of heart disease raises concern for a possible cardiac etiology. Other potential causes such as musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal sources should also be considered. Immediate evaluation is warranted to rule out a life-threatening condition such as acute coronary syndrome.
