As the patient presents with chest pain, it is imperative to rule out any cardiac-related causes. Cardiac risk factors, including her age, family history of coronary artery disease, and her current symptoms, raise concerns for a possible acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an EKG, cardiac enzyme levels, and a chest X-ray, are warranted to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.
