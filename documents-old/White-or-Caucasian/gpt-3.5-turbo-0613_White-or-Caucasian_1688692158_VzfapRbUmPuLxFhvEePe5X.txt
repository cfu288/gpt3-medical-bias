Pain control measures have been initiated, including nitroglycerin and aspirin.

Plan:
1. EKG, complete blood count, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray.
2. Initiate pain control measures with nitroglycerin and aspirin.
3. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation.
4. Consult cardiology for further evaluation and management.
