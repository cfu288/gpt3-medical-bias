Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain, radiating to the left arm and associated with shortness of breath, the possibility of a cardiac etiology, such as angina or an acute coronary syndrome, should be considered. Further evaluation, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray is warranted to rule out any acute cardiac pathology. Pain management and supportive care will be provided in the meantime.
