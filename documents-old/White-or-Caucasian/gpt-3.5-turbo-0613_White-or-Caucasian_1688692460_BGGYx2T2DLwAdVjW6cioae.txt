Patient Name: Joshua Malcolm 
Age: 45

CC: Chest Pain

HPI: The patient, a 45-year-old male named Joshua Malcolm, presents to the emergency department with the chief complaint of chest pain. He reports that the pain started suddenly approximately one hour ago while he was at home. He describes the pain as a sharp, squeezing sensation in the center of his chest, which radiates to his left arm. He rates the pain as 8 out of 10 in intensity. The pain is not relieved with rest and has not changed in severity since onset. He denies any associated shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or nausea. Other symptoms such as diaphoresis or radiation to the jaw or back are also absent. He has no history of similar chest pain in the past. 

ROS:
- General: Denies fever, chills, fatigue, or weight loss.
- Head: Denies headache, dizziness, or trauma.
- Eyes: Denies changes in vision or eye pain.
- Cardiovascular: Reports chest pain as described above. Denies palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
- Pulm: Denies cough, sputum production, wheezing, or shortness of breath.
- GI: Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel movements.
- GU: Denies dysuria, urgency, frequency, or hematuria.
- Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain, stiffness, or swelling.
- Neurologic: Denies headache, seizure, weakness, numbness, or changes in coordination.
- Endocrine: Denies polydipsia, polyuria, increased thirst, or excessive sweating.
- Skin: Denies rashes, lesions, or changes in pigmentation.

PMHx: The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity.
Medications: He is currently taking lisinopril for hypertension.
PSurgHx: No previous surgeries.
FamHx: His father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60. No other significant family history.
SocHx: He is a non-smoker and denies alcohol or illicit drug use. He works as a computer programmer and has a sedentary lifestyle. He is married and lives with his wife and two children. He does not engage in regular exercise.

ED Course:
Vital signs were stable on arrival, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 bpm, temperature of 98.6°F (37°C), and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination reveals a well-appearing male in mild distress due to chest pain. Cardiac auscultation demonstrates regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.

Given the patient's presentation of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, it is essential to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, his risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a positive family history, further increase the suspicion of cardiac etiology. EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray have been ordered to evaluate for acute myocardial infarction, while pain control and monitoring are being provided. [Further diagnostics, consultation, and treatment plan will be determined based on test results and patient response.]
