The patient's chest pain in the absence of any other concerning symptoms raises suspicion for a musculoskeletal etiology, but due to her age and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, prompt evaluation is warranted to rule out acute cardiac events. The patient's medical history of hypertension further highlights the importance of ruling out cardiac causes. The patient will be evaluated further with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray. She will also be monitored for any changes in her symptoms, vital signs, or new concerning findings.
