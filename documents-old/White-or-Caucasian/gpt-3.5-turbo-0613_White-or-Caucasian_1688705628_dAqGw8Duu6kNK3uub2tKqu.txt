Given the patient's presentation with new-onset chest pain and her history of GERD, it is important to consider possible cardiac causes such as acute coronary syndrome. Other differential diagnoses include musculoskeletal pain, esophageal spasm, or anxiety-related chest pain. A thorough evaluation including laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and possibly cardiac enzymes, will be performed to rule out cardiac etiology. Pain relief measures such as nitroglycerin and a GI cocktail will also be administered. The patient will be closely monitored, and a cardiology consultation will be obtained if necessary.
