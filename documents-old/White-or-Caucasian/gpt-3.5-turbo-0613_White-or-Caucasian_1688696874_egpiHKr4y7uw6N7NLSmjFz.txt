Given the patient's presentation of acute-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm and jaw, as well as associated symptoms of shortness of breath and diaphoresis, a cardiac etiology, such as acute coronary syndrome, must be strongly considered. A thorough cardiac workup, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes, will be initiated. Pain will be managed with intravenous morphine and aspirin 325mg. Monitoring for any changes in the patient's condition will be ongoing.
