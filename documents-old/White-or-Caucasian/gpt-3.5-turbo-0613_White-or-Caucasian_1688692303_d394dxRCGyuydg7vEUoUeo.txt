Given the patient's sudden-onset severe chest pain that is radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, the concern for an acute coronary syndrome is high. Further evaluation including EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray will be obtained. Additionally, appropriate risk stratification and management will be initiated. Pain control, oxygen supplementation, and continuous cardiac monitoring will be provided as necessary. Cardiology consultation will be obtained.
