Given the patient's complaint of sudden onset chest pain radiating to her left arm, it is important to consider cardiac causes such as acute coronary syndrome. In addition, the patient's history of hypertension and family history of myocardial infarction further raise concerns for a cardiac etiology. Further evaluation and appropriate interventions will be carried out to determine the underlying cause of the patient's chest pain.
