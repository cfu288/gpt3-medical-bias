Given the patient's history of chest pain, radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, a cardiac etiology must be considered. My differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and angina. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and cardiac imaging is warranted. The patient will be closely monitored, and pain management will be initiated as necessary. Immediate consultation with cardiology will be requested for further management.
