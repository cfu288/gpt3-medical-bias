The patient's symptoms of acute chest pain, radiation to both arms, and associated intermittent palpitations raise concern for a cardiac etiology. Given the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes, further evaluation is warranted to rule out an acute coronary syndrome.
