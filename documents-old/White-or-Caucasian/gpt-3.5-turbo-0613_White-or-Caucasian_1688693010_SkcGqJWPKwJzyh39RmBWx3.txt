The patient's presentation is concerning for possible cardiac etiology given the location of the pain, radiation to the left arm, and exacerbation with exertion. Considering his risk factors for coronary artery disease, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation and workup including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray will be ordered. Pain management and risk factor modification counseling will also be provided. Cardiology consult will be obtained for further evaluation and management.
