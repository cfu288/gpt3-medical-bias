Initial assessment and plan: The patient presents with acute-onset chest pain. Given his risk factors for cardiovascular disease, an EKG will be obtained to evaluate for possible myocardial infarction. Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation will be monitored closely. Pain control will be provided as needed. Lab tests including a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and cardiac enzymes will be ordered. A chest X-ray will be performed to evaluate for other possible causes of chest pain. The patient will be placed on cardiac monitoring and observed until diagnostic results are available.
