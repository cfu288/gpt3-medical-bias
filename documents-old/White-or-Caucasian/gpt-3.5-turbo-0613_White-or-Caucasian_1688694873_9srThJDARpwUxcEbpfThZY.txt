Given the patient's symptoms of crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm and his risk factors including hypertension and a family history of myocardial infarction, this presentation raises concerns for acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation and management with an EKG and laboratory studies including cardiac enzymes are warranted. Differential diagnosis also includes other causes of chest pain such as musculoskeletal pain or gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can be further explored depending on the results of initial investigations.
