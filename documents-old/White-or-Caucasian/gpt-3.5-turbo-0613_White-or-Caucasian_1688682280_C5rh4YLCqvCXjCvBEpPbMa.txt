Given the patient's age, sudden onset of chest pain at rest, and the location of pain, acute coronary syndrome is of concern. Other differentials to consider include musculoskeletal pain, pleuritic pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the chest pain. An EKG and laboratory tests will be ordered. Pain management and appropriate monitoring will be provided while awaiting further evaluation.
