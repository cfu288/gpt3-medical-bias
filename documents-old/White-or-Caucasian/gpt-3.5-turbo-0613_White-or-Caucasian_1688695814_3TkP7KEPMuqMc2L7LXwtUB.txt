Given the patient's age, risk factors, and the nature of his chest pain, it is crucial to consider a serious cardiac event such as an acute myocardial infarction in the differential diagnosis. Urgent evaluation, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes, is warranted to assess for possible cardiac ischemia. Close monitoring and aggressive pain control should be initiated while awaiting further workup.
