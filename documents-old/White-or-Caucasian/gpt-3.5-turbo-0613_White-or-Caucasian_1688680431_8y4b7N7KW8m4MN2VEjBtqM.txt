Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray will be necessary to rule out any acute cardiac pathology. Pain control and monitoring of vital signs will be initiated while awaiting further diagnostic tests. The patient will be given aspirin and oxygen as appropriate.
