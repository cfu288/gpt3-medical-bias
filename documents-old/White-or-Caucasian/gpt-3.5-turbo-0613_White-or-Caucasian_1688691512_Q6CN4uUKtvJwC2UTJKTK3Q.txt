The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 134/82 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, temperature of 98.6°F (37°C), and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Given the patient's age, symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, along with associated shortness of breath and sweating, a thorough workup for possible cardiac causes is warranted. The patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as his history of hypertension and former smoking status, further raise suspicion for cardiac etiology. A focused physical examination, EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray will be performed to evaluate for acute coronary syndrome as the underlying cause of his symptoms.
