The patient's presenting symptoms, including chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, raise concerns for acute coronary syndrome. [Further evaluations including an EKG and cardiac enzyme levels will be performed to assess for myocardial infarction. Cardiac monitoring and supplemental oxygen are also initiated.] The patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, further increase the suspicion for myocardial infarction. [Initial treatment will include aspirin 325 mg, nitroglycerin sublingual, and possible administration of opioid analgesic for pain relief.] The patient will be closely monitored and cardiology consultation will be obtained.
