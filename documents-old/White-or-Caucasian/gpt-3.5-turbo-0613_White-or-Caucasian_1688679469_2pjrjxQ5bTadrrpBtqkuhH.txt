Patient Name: Benedetto Lambert 
Age: 56

CC: Chest Pain

HPI: Mr. Lambert is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presents to the emergency department with chest pain. The pain is described as a crushing sensation in the center of the chest that radiates to his left arm. The pain started approximately 2 hours ago while he was at rest and has been constant since then. He denies any shortness of breath, palpitations, or lightheadedness. He also reports a significant history of smoking for the past 30 years, with a pack per day. He has never experienced this type of pain before.

FamHx: 
- Father had a myocardial infarction at age 60.

Based on the patient's history of crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm, his older age, and risk factors such as smoking, I am concerned about the possibility of acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation and appropriate management will be initiated.
