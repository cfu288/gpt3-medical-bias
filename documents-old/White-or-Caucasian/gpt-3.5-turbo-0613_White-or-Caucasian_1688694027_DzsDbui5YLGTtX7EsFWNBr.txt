Based on the patient's history of sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, and his risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension and family history), there is concern for a cardiac etiology. Further evaluation, including an EKG, troponin levels, and chest X-ray, will be necessary to assess for any acute coronary syndrome or other potential causes of his symptoms. Pain management and further work-up will be discussed with the attending physician.
