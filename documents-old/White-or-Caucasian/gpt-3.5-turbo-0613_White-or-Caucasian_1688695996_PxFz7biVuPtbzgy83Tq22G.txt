As the patient's primary physician, I am concerned about the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome given his age, symptoms, and risk factors. I will perform a thorough physical examination, including a cardiac workup, and order appropriate diagnostic tests, such as an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme studies, to further evaluate his chest pain. Education about the importance of seeking immediate medical attention for chest pain will be provided.
