Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset, severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, a differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome must be considered. Other possible causes of chest pain, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal strain, or anxiety, will also be assessed. Further evaluation of the patient's cardiovascular system, including EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray, will be obtained. Pain relief measures, such as nitroglycerin and analgesics, will be provided as appropriate. Close monitoring and consideration for admission may be warranted depending on the findings of the initial evaluation.
