Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset, sharp chest pain that worsens with inspiration and movement, a possible musculoskeletal etiology such as pleurisy or musculoskeletal strain should be considered. It is important to rule out serious cardiac etiologies such as acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction. A comprehensive evaluation will be performed, including a thorough physical examination and appropriate diagnostic tests. The plan will be individualized based on the findings.
