Given the acute onset of chest pain in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, further evaluation is warranted to rule out a cardiac etiology. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, angina, and other cardiac conditions. Further investigation with cardiac biomarkers, ECG, and imaging studies will help to establish a diagnosis and guide further management. Patient is being prepared for these investigations and will be closely monitored in the meantime.
