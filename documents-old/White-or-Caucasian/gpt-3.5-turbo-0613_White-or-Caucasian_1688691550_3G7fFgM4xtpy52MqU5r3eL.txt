The patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and palpitations, raise concern for a possible cardiac etiology. Given the patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease, including family history and hypertension, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential cause. Additionally, a thorough evaluation for other possible causes of chest pain, such as pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax, should be pursued. A focused physical examination, as well as further diagnostic testing, will be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.
