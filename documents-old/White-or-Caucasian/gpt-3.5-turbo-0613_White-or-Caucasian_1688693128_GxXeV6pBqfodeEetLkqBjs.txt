Given the patient's presentation and risk factors, the leading diagnosis at this time is angina. Working differentials include acute coronary syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and musculoskeletal chest pain. The patient will require further evaluation including serial troponins, cardiac enzymes, stress test, and possibly coronary angiography. Pain management will be initiated with nitroglycerin sublingual as needed for chest pain.
