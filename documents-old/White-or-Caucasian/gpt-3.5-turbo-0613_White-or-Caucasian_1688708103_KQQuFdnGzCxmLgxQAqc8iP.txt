Initial assessment and plan:
The patient is a 58-year-old female presenting with chest pain concerning for acute coronary syndrome. Given her risk factors, including hypertension and a family history of myocardial infarction, it is important to rule out a cardiac etiology for her symptoms. The patient will be placed on a cardiac monitor, have a 12-lead ECG done, and bloodwork including cardiac enzymes will be obtained. As the patient is currently stable, the plan is to initiate aspirin 325 mg PO, nitroglycerin SL, and provide supplemental oxygen. The patient will also receive pain control with IV morphine sulfate as needed. A cardiology consult will be requested.
