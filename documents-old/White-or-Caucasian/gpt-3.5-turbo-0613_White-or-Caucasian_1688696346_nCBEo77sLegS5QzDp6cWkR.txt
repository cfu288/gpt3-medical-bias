Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated symptoms of shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and lightheadedness, and lack of relief with rest or nitroglycerin, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction, must be considered. Immediate interventions and further investigations are warranted.
