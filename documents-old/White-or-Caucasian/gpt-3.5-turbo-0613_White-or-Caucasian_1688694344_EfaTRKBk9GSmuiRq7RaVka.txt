This history is concerning for a possible acute coronary syndrome. Given the symptoms of acute chest pain, radiation to the left arm, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and associated risk factors such as age, hypertension, and smoking, urgent evaluation and management are required to rule out an acute myocardial infarction. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and appropriate imaging studies as indicated. Chest pain protocol will be followed and cardiology consultation will be obtained. Pain control and monitoring for any changes will be initiated.
