Given the patient's presentation of acute chest pain with atypical symptoms, further evaluation is necessary to rule out a cardiac etiology. A detailed physical examination, EKG, and laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes will be ordered. Additionally, a chest x-ray and further diagnostic studies may be considered based on the initial findings. Patient will be closely monitored for any changes in symptoms and vital signs.
