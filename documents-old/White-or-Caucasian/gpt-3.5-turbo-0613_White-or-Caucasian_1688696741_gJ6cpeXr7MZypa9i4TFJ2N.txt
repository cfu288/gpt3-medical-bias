Given the patient's presentation with chest pain and associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease, further evaluation is warranted to rule out an acute coronary syndrome. The plan includes ordering an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray to assess for any signs of acute myocardial infarction or other cardiac abnormalities. Pain management and risk factor modification will also be addressed during the course of treatment. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and symptoms will be essential. A cardiology consultation may be requested depending on the results of initial investigations.
