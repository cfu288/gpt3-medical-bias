Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain, radiating to the left arm and associated with sweating, the differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, specifically acute myocardial infarction. Other differentials to consider would be angina, musculoskeletal pain, or aortic dissection. Cardiac workup, including an EKG, troponin levels, and a chest X-ray, will be ordered. Immediate management will involve ensuring the patient's stability, administration of oxygen, and initiating treatment for possible myocardial infarction. The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in symptoms and vital signs. A cardiology consultation will be requested for further evaluation.
