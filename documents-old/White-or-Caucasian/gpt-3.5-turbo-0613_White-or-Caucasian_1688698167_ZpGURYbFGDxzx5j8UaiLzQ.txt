Assessment and Plan:
- This 55-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain radiating to the left arm. Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, acute coronary syndrome is a concern. The initial assessment will include obtaining vital signs, EKG, and blood work to evaluate for myocardial infarction. The patient will also be placed on supplemental oxygen, and nitroglycerin will be administered sublingually for pain relief. A stat troponin level will be ordered to evaluate for cardiac injury. The patient's pain and vital signs will be monitored closely. Additionally, the patient will be started on aspirin and a beta-blocker, pending further evaluation. Cardiology consultation and admission to the telemetry unit will be considered based on the patient's EKG and troponin findings.
