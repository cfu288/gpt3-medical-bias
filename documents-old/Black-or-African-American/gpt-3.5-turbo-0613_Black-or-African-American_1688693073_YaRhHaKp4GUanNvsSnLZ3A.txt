Given the patient's age, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and the sudden onset of chest pain, it is important to rule out any acute cardiac pathology as the cause of her symptoms. A thorough physical examination and further diagnostic workup, including an EKG, cardiac biomarkers, and imaging studies, will be performed to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's chest pain. Appropriate pain management and monitoring will be instituted.
