The patient's chest pain, described as sudden onset, severe, and radiating to the left arm and jaw, raises concern for a possible cardiac etiology. Given her risk factors for coronary artery disease, further evaluation is warranted. A focused examination, EKG, troponin level, and imaging studies will be ordered to assess for acute coronary syndrome. Pain management and close monitoring for any worsening of symptoms will be provided in the meantime. A cardiology consult will be obtained for further management and disposition planning.
