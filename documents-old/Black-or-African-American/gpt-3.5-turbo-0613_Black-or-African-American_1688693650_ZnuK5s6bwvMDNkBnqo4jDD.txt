The patient's chest pain raises concern for a cardiac etiology, given her risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the presence of associated symptoms such as shortness of breath. Further evaluation including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and monitoring for any dynamic changes in her symptoms will be necessary to determine the cause of her chest pain. The differential diagnosis should also include other causes such as musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal reflux disease, or anxiety.
