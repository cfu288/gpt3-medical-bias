Given the patient's presenting complaint of chest pain with radiation to the left arm, further evaluation is needed to rule out a cardiac etiology. A complete physical examination will be performed, including vital signs, auscultation of the heart and lungs, and an electrocardiogram. Laboratory tests, including cardiac enzymes and a complete blood count, will also be ordered. The patient will be closely monitored, and pain management will be initiated as needed.
