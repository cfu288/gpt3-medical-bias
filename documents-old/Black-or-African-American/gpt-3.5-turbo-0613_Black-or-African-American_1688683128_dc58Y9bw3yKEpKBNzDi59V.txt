Given the patient's age, risk factors, and the characteristics of the chest pain radiating to the left arm, concern for cardiac etiology is high. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG, troponin levels, and a chest x-ray. Pain management will be provided as needed. Cardiology and/or interventional radiology consultation may be considered depending on the results of initial testing.
