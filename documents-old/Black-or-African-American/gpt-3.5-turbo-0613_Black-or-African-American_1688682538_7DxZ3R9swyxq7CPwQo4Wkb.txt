Based on the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the possibility of acute coronary syndrome is of concern. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing will be pursued, including an ECG, cardiac enzymes, and potentially a stress test or coronary angiography as indicated. Pain management and close monitoring will also be initiated. Disposition planning will depend on the results of further evaluation and risk stratification.
