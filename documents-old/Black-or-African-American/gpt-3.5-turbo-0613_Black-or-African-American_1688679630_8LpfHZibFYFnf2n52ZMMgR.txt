Based on the patient's presentation of crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath and diaphoresis, the concern for cardiac etiology, specifically acute coronary syndrome, is high. The patient was immediately evaluated and treated accordingly in the emergency department. Further investigations, including an ECG and cardiac enzyme levels, were obtained to rule out an acute myocardial infarction. The patient was placed on cardiac monitoring and administered aspirin, beta-blocker, and a statin as per protocol. The cardiology team was consulted and the patient is awaiting further evaluation. Further management will depend on the results of the investigations.
