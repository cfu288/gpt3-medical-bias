Patient Name: Delphine Moore 
Age: 47

CC: Chest Pain
HPI: The patient, a 47-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain began approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a pressure-like sensation that radiates to her left arm. The pain is associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. The patient denies any recent trauma, exercise, or lifting heavy objects. She recalls a similar but less severe episode of chest pain two weeks ago that resolved spontaneously.

- Head: The patient denies any headache, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.

- Cardiovascular: The patient reports intermittent palpitations but denies any history of irregular heartbeats.
- Pulm: The patient denies any cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath at rest.

PMHx: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. She had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) 5 years ago.

Medications: The patient takes losartan 50 mg daily for hypertension and atorvastatin 40 mg daily for hyperlipidemia.

PSurgHx: The patient had a CABG 5 years ago. She denies any other surgeries.

FamHx: The patient's father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. Her mother is alive and has hypertension and diabetes.

SocHx: The patient is a nonsmoker and denies any alcohol or drug use. She works as a cashier at a local grocery store and lives with her husband and two children.

Given the patient's symptoms of chest pain, radiating to the left arm, associated shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, further evaluation will be necessary to assess for a potential myocardial infarction. The patient's past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous CABG surgery further increase her cardiovascular risk. Immediate EKG, cardiac biomarkers, and a chest X-ray will be ordered. Pain management and monitoring of vital signs will also be initiated.
