Given the patient's presentation of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath, it is important to consider a cardiac cause such as myocardial infarction. Other differentials would include musculoskeletal pain, pulmonary embolism, pleuritic pain, or gastrointestinal causes. Further evaluation, including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray, will be performed to assess for possible cardiac etiologies. An urgent cardiac consult will be requested for further evaluation and management. Pain management and monitoring will be provided in the meantime.
