Given the patient's age, chief complaint of chest pain, and risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, there is concern for a possible cardiac etiology of the chest pain. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray will be performed. Pain control measures will also be implemented as needed.
