Given the patient's presentation of chest pain and shortness of breath, further evaluation including lab work, cardiac enzyme testing, and a chest X-ray will be ordered to assess for possible cardiac etiology. Chest pain in this patient population is of significant concern given the potential for acute coronary syndrome or other cardiovascular causes. Immediate intervention may be required if indicated.
