Given the patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm and associated shortness of breath, a workup for potential cardiac etiology is warranted. The patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, are noted. Further evaluation will include an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray to assess for acute coronary syndrome or other cardiac pathology. Pain control and strict monitoring will be implemented during the evaluation. Cardiology consultation will be requested for further management.
