Given the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including her age, hypertension, and family history, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a possible cause of her chest pain. Other differentials to consider include musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Further evaluation, including an ECG and laboratory tests such as troponin levels, will help guide further management.
