Based on the patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, there is concern for a cardiac etiology such as acute coronary syndrome. A thorough evaluation including EKG, cardiac enzymes, and possibly coronary angiography should be initiated. In addition, consideration should be given to ruling out other potential causes of chest pain, such as pulmonary embolism or pericarditis. Pain management and close monitoring of vital signs should be prioritized.
