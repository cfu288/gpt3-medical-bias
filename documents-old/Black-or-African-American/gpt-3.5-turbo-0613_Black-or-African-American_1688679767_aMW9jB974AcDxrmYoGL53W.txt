PMHx: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago and is currently on lisinopril. He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia 3 years ago and is taking simvastatin.

Medications: Lisinopril 20 mg once daily, simvastatin 40 mg once daily.

PSurgHx: No prior surgeries.

FamHx: The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions in other family members.

SocHx: The patient is a smoker, with a 20 pack-year history. He admits to occasional alcohol use but denies any illicit drug use. He is currently employed as a construction worker.

Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, his risk factors for coronary artery disease (hypertension, hyperlipidemia), and his positive family history of myocardial infarction, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a possible diagnosis. Further evaluation and management should include an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and possible admission to a telemetry unit for further monitoring.
