Based on the patient's sudden onset of chest pain, with radiation to the left arm and jaw, and the absence of mitigating factors such as change in position or breathing, a concern for acute coronary syndrome is raised. Given the patient's age, smoking history, and history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, other potential etiologies such as aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism should also be considered. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest x-ray.
