Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset severe crushing chest pain that radiates to her left arm, associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, the main concern is acute myocardial infarction. Other differentials to consider include unstable angina, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection. Further evaluation and investigations, such as electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray, are needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
