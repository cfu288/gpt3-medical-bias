The patient's presentation of chest pain is concerning for possible cardiac etiology, given the burning sensation, radiation to the left arm, and aggravation by deep breathing. Given the patient's age, gender, and family history of myocardial infarction, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a potential cause. However, other differential diagnoses such as musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pericarditis should also be considered. Further evaluation and risk stratification are necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's chest pain. The patient will be evaluated with an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a comprehensive physical examination. Appropriate interventions and further management will be determined based on the findings.
