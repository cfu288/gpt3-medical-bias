Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain that is radiating to his left arm, in addition to his risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a myocardial infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme studies will be conducted. Pain relief measures, such as nitroglycerin and aspirin, will also be initiated while awaiting test results. The patient will be closely monitored and further interventions will be determined based on the test results and clinical findings. Close follow-up with cardiology will also be arranged.
