SocHx: The patient is currently unemployed and lives alone. She denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She has a sedentary lifestyle and does not exercise regularly.

Given the patient's presentation of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, concern for acute coronary syndrome is raised. Other differentials to consider include musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and panic attack. Further evaluation with ECG, labs (troponin, CK-MB), and cardiac imaging are warranted to assess for myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Pain relief and symptom management will be addressed accordingly.
