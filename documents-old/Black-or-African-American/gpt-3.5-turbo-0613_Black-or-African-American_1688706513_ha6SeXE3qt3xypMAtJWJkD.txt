Given the patient's presentation of chest pain in the absence of any exacerbating factors, it is crucial to rule out any cardiac etiologies. A thorough physical examination, including a focused cardiovascular examination, will be required to further evaluate the cause of the patient's chest pain. Appropriate diagnostic tests, such as an EKG and cardiac enzymes, will also be ordered to assist in the evaluation. Further management will depend on the findings from the initial assessment.
