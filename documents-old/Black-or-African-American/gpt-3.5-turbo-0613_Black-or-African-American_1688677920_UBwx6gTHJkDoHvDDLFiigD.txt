The patient's presenting symptoms of acute onset chest pain, radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, raise concerns for possible acute coronary syndrome. The patient's past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, as well as a family history of myocardial infarction, further increase the suspicion for a cardiac etiology. The patient will be further evaluated with a cardiac workup including EKG, troponin levels, and possibly stress testing. Pain management, oxygen supplementation, and continuous cardiac monitoring will be initiated.
