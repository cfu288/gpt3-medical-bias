Given the patient's presenting complaint of chest pain, further evaluation and management are indicated to rule out a cardiac etiology. The patient will be further evaluated with an EKG, cardiac enzyme levels, and a chest X-ray. Additional laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipid panel, may also be ordered to assess the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile. Pain control measures and a continuous EKG monitoring will be initiated while awaiting these results. The patient will be admitted to the cardiac observation unit for further management and monitoring. Cardiology consult will also be obtained for further evaluation and recommendations.
