Based on the patient's presentation and risk factors, my leading diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome, specifically a possible myocardial infarction. The plan is to obtain an EKG, troponin levels, a chest X-ray, and administer aspirin and nitroglycerin for symptomatic relief. A cardiology consult and admission to the hospital will be considered depending on the results of the initial workup.
