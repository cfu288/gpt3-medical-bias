CC: Chest Pain
HPI: The patient, a 50-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation in the center of her chest that radiates to her left arm. The pain started approximately 2 hours ago while she was resting at home. She denies any associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting. She also denies any recent trauma or history of similar symptoms. There is no exacerbating or relieving factors.

- Neurologic: No weakness, numbness or tingling.
- Endocrine: No excessive thirst or urination.
- Skin: No rash, bruising or changes in moles.

PMHx: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She had been taking lisinopril and simvastatin, but she states that she ran out of both medications about a month ago and has not been able to refill them.

Medications: None currently.

PSurgHx: No significant surgical history.

FamHx: Her father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 62. Her mother is still alive with hypertension and diabetes. She has two siblings who are both healthy.

SocHx: She is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. She works as a receptionist and is married with two grown children.

Based on the patient's history and presenting symptoms, there is concern for possible myocardial infarction given the characteristic chest pain radiating to the left arm and absence of any respiratory symptoms. Given her significant past medical history and lack of recent medication use, medication non-adherence may have contributed to her current symptoms. A workup with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray will be ordered to evaluate for acute coronary syndrome. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in her symptoms.
