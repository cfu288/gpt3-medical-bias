Initial assessment and plan: A 45-year-old male presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain consistent with angina. Given the severity and duration of symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to rule out an acute coronary syndrome. The initial plan includes obtaining an EKG, cardiac enzyme levels, and a chest X-ray. The patient will be placed on a cardiac monitor, given oxygen via nasal cannula, and started on sublingual nitroglycerin for pain. Notify the cardiologist for urgent evaluation.
