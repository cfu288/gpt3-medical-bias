Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain, associated symptoms of shortness of breath, and risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and hypertension, further evaluation is warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. EKG, cardiac biomarkers, and a chest x-ray will be ordered to aid in diagnosis. She will be placed on a cardiac monitor and given oxygen via nasal cannula.
