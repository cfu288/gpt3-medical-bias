Given the patient's sudden onset of sharp chest pain radiating to the left arm, his risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and the exacerbation of the pain with physical activity, myocardial infarction and unstable angina should be considered and ruled out. Differential diagnosis also includes pericarditis, musculoskeletal pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Further evaluation and investigation are necessary to determine the etiology of the patient's symptoms.
