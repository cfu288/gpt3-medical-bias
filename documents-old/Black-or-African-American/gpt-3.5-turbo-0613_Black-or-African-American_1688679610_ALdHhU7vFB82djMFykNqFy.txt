Initial assessment and plan: The patient presents with a concerning history of chest pain that radiates to the left arm, raising the possibility of cardiac etiology. Given her risk factors for coronary artery disease and family history of myocardial infarction, it is essential to rule out acute coronary syndrome. The patient will be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring, have serial troponin levels checked, receive an EKG, and further evaluation and management will be guided by the results. Pain management and counseling regarding lifestyle modifications will also be appropriate.
