Based on the patient's history of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, his risk factors including age, male gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, family history, and smoking, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction, needs to be considered. Urgent interventions such as an electrocardiogram, laboratory tests (troponin, CK-MB), and an echocardiogram should be performed to assess the patient's cardiac status and determine the appropriate management plan.
