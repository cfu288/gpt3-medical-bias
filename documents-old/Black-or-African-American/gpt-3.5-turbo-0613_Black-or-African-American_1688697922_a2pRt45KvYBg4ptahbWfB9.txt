Based on the patient's presentation of chest pain with radiation to the left arm and the possibility of cardiac risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a positive family history of myocardial infarction, the concern for an acute coronary syndrome is high. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause of her symptoms. The patient has been placed on a cardiac monitor, and an EKG and laboratory tests have been ordered. Pain is being managed with nitroglycerin and aspirin. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she appears comfortable at the moment. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient and provide appropriate interventions based on the clinical findings.
