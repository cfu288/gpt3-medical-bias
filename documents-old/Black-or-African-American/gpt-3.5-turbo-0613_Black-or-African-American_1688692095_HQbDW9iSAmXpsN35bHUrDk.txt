Sublingual Nitroglycerin provided some relief of the patient's pain. He has been started on oxygen at 2L/min via nasal cannula. Cardiac enzymes have been ordered.

Plan:
- Continue monitoring vital signs and cardiac rhythm
- Administer morphine sulfate for pain control as needed
- Obtain further cardiac workup, including troponin levels and a 12-lead EKG
- Consider cardiology consultation for possible catheterization and intervention
