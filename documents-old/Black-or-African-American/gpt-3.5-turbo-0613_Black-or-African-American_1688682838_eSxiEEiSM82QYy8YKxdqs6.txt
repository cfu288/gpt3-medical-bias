Based on the patient's history of chest pain associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, along with risk factors such as smoking and a family history of myocardial infarction, an acute coronary syndrome is concerning. The patient will be triaged and have an EKG performed immediately to evaluate for any acute ST-segment elevation or other cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes and a complete blood count will also be obtained. The patient will be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring, and aspirin will be administered orally while awaiting further evaluation. He will be closely monitored and promptly evaluated by a physician to further assess and manage his condition.
