Based on the patient's presenting symptoms of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm and associated shortness of breath, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as the primary concern. Given the patient's risk factors of age, family history of heart attack, and hypertension, it is crucial to rule out myocardial infarction or angina. Further evaluation including ECG, cardiac enzymes, and a thorough physical examination will be done to determine the appropriate management for this patient.
