The patient is a young male presenting with sudden onset chest pain, concerning for possible cardiac etiology. Given the severity of the pain, a thorough evaluation is warranted including a detailed history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic workup. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes but is not limited to myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, gastrointestinal pathology, and musculoskeletal causes. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits at this time. EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray will be ordered. The patient will be closely monitored, and pain management will be initiated as needed. Cardiology and pulmonology consultations will be obtained. Strict bed rest and continuous telemetry will be implemented until a definitive diagnosis is made. Further management will be guided by the results of the workup.
