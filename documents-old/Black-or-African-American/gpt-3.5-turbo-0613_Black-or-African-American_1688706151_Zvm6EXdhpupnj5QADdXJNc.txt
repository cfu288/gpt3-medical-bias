Given the patient's age, the sudden onset of severe chest pain, and the radiation to the left arm, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome needs to be considered. A prompt evaluation including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray should be done to rule out an acute myocardial infarction or other cardiac pathology. Pain management and hemodynamic stabilization will be addressed in the plan.
