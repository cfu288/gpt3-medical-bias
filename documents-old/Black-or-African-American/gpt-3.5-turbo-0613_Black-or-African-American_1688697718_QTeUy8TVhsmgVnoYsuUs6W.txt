Based on the patient's description of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, along with the absence of associated symptoms such as shortness of breath or diaphoresis, the possibility of cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction needs to be considered. Further evaluation and appropriate diagnostic studies, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, will be initiated to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Pain management and monitoring of vital signs will be provided while awaiting test results.
