The patient's symptoms of severe, persistent chest pain, radiating to the left arm with no identifiable precipitating or relieving factors, raise concern for acute coronary syndrome. Given the patient's history of a similar episode in the past, a myocardial infarction must be considered. Further evaluation and management are necessary to rule out myocardial ischemia and determine the appropriate course of treatment.
