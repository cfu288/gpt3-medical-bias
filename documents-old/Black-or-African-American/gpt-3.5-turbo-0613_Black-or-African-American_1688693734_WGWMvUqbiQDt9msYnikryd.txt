A complete physical examination was performed, including vital signs and a detailed cardiac examination. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and cardiac enzymes, were ordered and will be reviewed upon completion. The patient was also placed on continuous cardiac monitoring, and an electrocardiogram was obtained.

Further assessment and treatment will be determined based on the results of the laboratory tests and further evaluation of the patient.

Given the patient's age, gender, and risk factors, it is important to consider acute coronary syndrome as a possible cause of his chest pain. Other differentials to consider include musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal pathology, and pulmonary embolism.
