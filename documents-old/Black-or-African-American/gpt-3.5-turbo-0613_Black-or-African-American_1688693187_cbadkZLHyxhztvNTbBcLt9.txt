Based on the patient's history of sudden onset chest pain, with radiation to the left arm, along with shortness of breath and lightheadedness, it is important to rule out potential cardiac causes such as myocardial infarction or angina. The patient's hypertension and family history of heart disease are also concerning. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing, including an ECG, cardiac enzymes, and possibly a stress test, will be warranted to determine the cause of her symptoms.
