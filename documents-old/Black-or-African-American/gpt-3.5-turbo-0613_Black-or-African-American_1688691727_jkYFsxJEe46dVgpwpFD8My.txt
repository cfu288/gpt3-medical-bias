Initial assessment and plan:
The patient's chief complaint of substernal chest pain radiating to both arms raises concerns for possible cardiac ischemia. As such, a detailed physical examination will be performed, and an EKG and cardiac enzymes will be ordered. Analgesics will be provided as needed for pain relief. Further management will be determined based on the results of the initial evaluation.
