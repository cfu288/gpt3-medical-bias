Based on the patient's symptoms of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, the leading diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome, specifically an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Other differentials to consider include angina, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
