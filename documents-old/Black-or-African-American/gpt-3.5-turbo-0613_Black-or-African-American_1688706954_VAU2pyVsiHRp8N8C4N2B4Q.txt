The patient's symptoms of substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, raise concerns for an acute coronary syndrome. Given the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, it is important to rule out a myocardial infarction. Further evaluation and management are warranted, including an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and consideration of emergent cardiac catheterization.
