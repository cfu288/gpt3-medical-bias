Given the patient's presenting symptoms of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath, concern for a cardiac etiology such as acute coronary syndrome including myocardial infarction is high on the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation and management is warranted, including an EKG, cardiac biomarkers, and consideration for revascularization.
