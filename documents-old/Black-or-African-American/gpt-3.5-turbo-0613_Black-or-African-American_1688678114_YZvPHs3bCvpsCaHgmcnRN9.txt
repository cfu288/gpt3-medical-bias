Given the patient's presentation of sudden onset substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, with a significant cardiovascular risk factor of hypertension and a family history of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is high on the differential diagnosis. The patient will require further evaluation including EKG, cardiac enzymes, and cardiac consultation.
