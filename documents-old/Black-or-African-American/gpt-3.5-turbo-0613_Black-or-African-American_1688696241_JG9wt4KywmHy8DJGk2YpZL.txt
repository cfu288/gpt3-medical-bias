Based on the patient's history and symptoms, an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction or unstable angina, needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation with an EKG and cardiac enzymes is warranted to assess for ischemic changes or myocardial injury. Immediate treatment should include oxygen therapy, aspirin administration, and nitroglycerin for pain relief if there are no contraindications. The patient should also be connected to continuous cardiac monitoring and have close monitoring of his vital signs. In addition, his blood pressure should be controlled. Further diagnostic workup, including cardiac catheterization, may be necessary depending on the findings. The patient should be admitted for further management and evaluation by the cardiology team.
