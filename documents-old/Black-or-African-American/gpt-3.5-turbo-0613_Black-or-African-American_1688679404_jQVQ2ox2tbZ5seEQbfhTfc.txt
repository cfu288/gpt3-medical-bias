Given the patient's presentation of sudden, severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, and his risk factors including smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and a family history of hypertension, it is important to consider a cardiac etiology for his symptoms such as acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina. A thorough cardiac workup including an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and a chest X-ray will be necessary.
