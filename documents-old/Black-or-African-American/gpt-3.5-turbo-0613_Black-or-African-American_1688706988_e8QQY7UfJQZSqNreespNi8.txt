The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, raise concern for a possible acute coronary syndrome. The patient's risk factors include age, male sex, smoking history, and a family history of premature coronary artery disease. Further evaluation including electrocardiogram, troponin levels, and further cardiac workup is warranted to rule out ischemic heart disease.
