Based on the patient's history and presentation of sudden onset chest pain, radiating to the left arm, with associated shortness of breath and nausea, the differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, specifically myocardial infarction, as well as other cardiac causes such as angina, pericarditis, or aortic dissection. It is also important to consider non-cardiac causes such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), musculoskeletal pain, or anxiety. Further evaluation and diagnostic workup are needed to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.
