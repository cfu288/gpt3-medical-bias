Based on the patient's history of chest pain, associated symptoms, and risk factors, concern for acute coronary syndrome such as angina or myocardial infarction is high. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme levels will be performed to evaluate for ischemic changes. A chest x-ray will also be considered to rule out other potential causes of chest pain. Pain management and cardiac monitoring will be initiated in the meantime.
