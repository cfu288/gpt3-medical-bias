Based on the patient's presentation and history, the differential diagnosis for the chest pain includes musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), costochondritis, anxiety, and less likely, acute coronary syndrome. A detailed physical examination and further investigations will be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and determine appropriate management. The plan includes obtaining an EKG, ordering laboratory tests such as cardiac enzymes and a complete blood count, and considering imaging like a chest X-ray. Pain relief measures may be discussed with the patient depending on the diagnosis. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in the clinical course.
