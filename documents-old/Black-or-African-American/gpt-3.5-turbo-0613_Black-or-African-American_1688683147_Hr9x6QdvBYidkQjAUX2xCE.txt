HPI: The patient, a 45-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She reports that the pain began suddenly about two hours ago while she was at rest. She describes the pain as a crushing sensation in the center of her chest that radiates to her left arm. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea. She reports no history of chest pain or cardiac issues in the past.

PMHx: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril daily. She reports that her blood pressure has been well controlled on this medication. No other significant medical history reported.

Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg once daily.

PSurgHx: No previous surgeries reported.

FamHx: The patient reports a positive family history of coronary artery disease, with her father having suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 55.

SocHx: The patient is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. She works as an office manager and lives with her husband and two children.

Given the patient's presentation of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm and a positive family history of coronary artery disease, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction, must be considered. Further evaluation, including cardiac biomarkers and an electrocardiogram, is warranted. The patient will be monitored closely and continue to receive appropriate treatment as necessary.
