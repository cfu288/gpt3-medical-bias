Given the patient's age, risk factors, and presenting symptoms, an acute coronary syndrome must be ruled out. EKG and cardiac enzymes will be obtained, and the patient will be monitored closely. A chest X-ray will also be ordered to rule out other etiologies of chest pain. Pain management and antiplatelet therapy will be initiated as appropriate. Close cardiology follow-up will be arranged.
