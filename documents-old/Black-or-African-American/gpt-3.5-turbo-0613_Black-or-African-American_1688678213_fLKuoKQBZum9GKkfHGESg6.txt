Based on the patient's presentation, his sudden onset of severe chest pain, associated symptoms of shortness of breath and diaphoresis, and absence of known risk factors, it is important to consider cardiac etiologies such as acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction. Additional cardiac work-up including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes will be necessary to evaluate and treat appropriately. Chest pain of non-cardiac origin, such as musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal causes, will also be considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient will be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
