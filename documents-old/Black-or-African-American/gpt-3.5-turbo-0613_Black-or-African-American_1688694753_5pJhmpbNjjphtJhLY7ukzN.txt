Patient Name: Dorothy Stanberry 
Age: [62]

CC: Chest Pain

HPI: The patient, a 62-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She states that the pain began suddenly approximately one hour ago while she was at home watching television. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation, located in the center of her chest. The pain is radiating to her left arm and jaw. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath or diaphoresis. She states that the pain is not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She denies any previous cardiac events. She admits to smoking one pack per day for the past 30 years. She denies alcohol or illicit drug use.

ROS:
- General: No fevers, chills, or weight loss.
- Head: No headache or dizziness.
- Eyes: No visual changes or double vision.
- Cardiovascular: Positive for current chest pain. Negative for palpitations or edema.
- Pulm: No cough or shortness of breath.
- GI: No nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
- GU: No dysuria or hematuria.
- Musculoskeletal: Positive for pain radiating to the left arm.
- Neurologic: No weakness or numbness.
- Endocrine: No polyuria or polydipsia.
- Skin: No rashes or lesions.

PMHx: The patient has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Medications: The patient is currently taking losartan for blood pressure control and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.

PSurgHx: No previous surgeries.

FamHx: The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. Mother is alive and well with no known cardiac history. One brother died at the age of 50 from a heart attack.

SocHx: The patient is a 30 pack-year smoker but denies alcohol or illicit drug use. She is married and lives with her husband who is currently healthy.

Pertinent negatives in the history include no associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or relief with rest or nitroglycerin. Given the patient's risk factors and presentation of chest pain radiating to the left arm and jaw, a concern for cardiac etiology, such as acute coronary syndrome, is highest on the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation and workup will be performed accordingly.
