Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, it is important to consider a possible cardiovascular etiology such as acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction.

Further evaluation with a physical examination, electrocardiogram, and cardiac enzymes is warranted to rule out any cardiac pathology.
