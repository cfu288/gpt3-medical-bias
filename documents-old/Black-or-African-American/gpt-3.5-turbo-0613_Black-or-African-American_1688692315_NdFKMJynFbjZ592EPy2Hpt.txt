Patient Name: Elsa Elder 
Age: 45

CC: Chest Pain
HPI: The patient, Elsa Elder, a 45-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, presents to the emergency department with complaints of sharp, substernal chest pain. The pain started suddenly about two hours ago while she was resting at home. She describes the pain as 8/10 in severity, radiating to her left arm. The pain is not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. She denies any shortness of breath, palpitations, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness. She does report associated nausea. She has never experienced similar symptoms in the past.

ROS:
- General: No fever, weight changes, or fatigue.
- Head: No headache, syncope, or head trauma.
- Eyes: No visual changes or double vision.
- Cardiovascular: No palpitations or edema.
- Pulm: No cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath.
- GI: No abdominal pain, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits.
- GU: No urinary symptoms or abnormal vaginal discharge.
- Musculoskeletal: No joint pain or stiffness, no muscle weakness.
- Neurologic: No weakness, numbness, or tingling.
- Endocrine: No polyuria, polydipsia, or changes in appetite.
- Skin: No rash, itching, or lesions.

PMHx: 
- Hypertension, diagnosed 5 years ago and on Lisinopril 10mg daily.
- Hyperlipidemia, diagnosed 7 years ago, and taking Atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime.
- No history of diabetes.

Medications:
- Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension.
- Atorvastatin 20mg daily at bedtime for hyperlipidemia.

PSurgHx: No previous surgeries.

FamHx: Mother had hypertension and father had a history of myocardial infarction.

SocHx: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use.

The patient's chest pain is concerning for a possible myocardial infarction, given the sharp, substernal nature of the pain, radiation to the left arm, associated nausea, and lack of relief with rest or nitroglycerin. Further evaluation with an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and possibly a stress test is warranted to assess for acute coronary syndrome.
