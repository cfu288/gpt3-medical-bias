Based on the patient's history of substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm with associated shortness of breath, further evaluation for a possible cardiac cause is warranted. Possible differential diagnoses include angina, myocardial infarction, and pericarditis. The patient's history of hypertension and positive family history of heart disease also raise concerns for cardiac involvement. Further investigations, including an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes, will be performed to aid in the diagnosis and guide management. Pain control and close monitoring of vital signs will be provided in the meantime.
