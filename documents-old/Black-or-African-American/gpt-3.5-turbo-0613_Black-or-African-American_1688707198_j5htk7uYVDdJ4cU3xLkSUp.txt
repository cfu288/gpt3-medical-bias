Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain with radiation to the left arm, it is important to consider a possible cardiac etiology. Given her age and history of hypertension, acute coronary syndrome should be considered and ruled out. Other differentials such as musculoskeletal pain, anxiety, or gastrointestinal causes should also be considered. Further assessment, including an ECG and appropriate lab work, should be performed to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status and determine the appropriate course of action.
