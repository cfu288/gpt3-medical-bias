[Chest pain in a middle-aged woman should be evaluated thoroughly to rule out cardiac causes. Given the patient's age, gender, and description of pain radiating to the left arm, a myocardial infarction or angina should be considered. Other possible causes include musculoskeletal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or anxiety. An electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and further evaluation will be necessary to determine the cause of the chest pain.]
