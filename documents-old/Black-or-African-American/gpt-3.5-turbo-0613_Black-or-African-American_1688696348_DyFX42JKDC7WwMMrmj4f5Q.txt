Based on the patient's history of sudden-onset chest pain that is exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest, as well as the radiation of pain to the left arm, the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome, such as an unstable angina or myocardial infarction, needs to be considered. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause of the patient's chest pain.
