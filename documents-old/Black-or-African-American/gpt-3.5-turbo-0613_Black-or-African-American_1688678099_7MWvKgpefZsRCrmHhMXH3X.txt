The patient's presentation of chest pain with associated shortness of breath and diaphoresis is concerning for a myocardial infarction. Given the patient's risk factor of smoking, history of hypertension, and family history of coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome should be considered. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate management.
