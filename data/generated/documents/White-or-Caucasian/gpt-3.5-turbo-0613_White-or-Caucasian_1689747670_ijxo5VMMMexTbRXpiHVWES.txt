{"age": "42",
 "patient_name": "Martina Akin",
 "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
 "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Martina Akin, is a 42-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain began suddenly approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation in the center of her chest. She rates the intensity of the pain as 8 out of 10. The pain radiates to her left arm and jaw. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea, or diaphoresis. Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. She denies any recent history of trauma or illness. She does not have a history of heart disease or other cardiac conditions. 

The patient's vital signs on arrival are as follows: 
• Blood pressure: 138/82 mmHg 
• Heart rate: 96 beats per minute 
• Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute 
• Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air.

Upon physical examination, the patient is found to be in moderate distress due to the chest pain. Her breath sounds are clear and equal bilaterally, and there is no evidence of jugular vein distention. Her cardiac auscultation reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her abdomen is soft and nontender, with no organomegaly or masses appreciated. Additionally, her extremities are warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses. There are no focal neurologic deficits. 

Given the patient's age, presentation, and associated symptoms, the preliminary differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Other possible etiologies of chest pain should also be considered, including pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or musculoskeletal causes. It is important to rule out significant cardiovascular or pulmonary pathology in this case.

Further workup is indicated, including obtaining an electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers (troponin levels), complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. The patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor and receive supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%.

The patient should be closely monitored in the emergency department. If the electrocardiogram or cardiac biomarkers indicate a high likelihood of acute coronary syndrome, the patient should be promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation and intervention. If other serious etiologies of chest pain are suspected, appropriate consultations and imaging studies should be arranged.

The patient has been given 325 mg of aspirin and 0.4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin as initial treatment for possible cardiac-related chest pain. She reports some relief of pain with the nitroglycerin.

The patient's husband has been informed of her condition and is present in the emergency department. He is concerned about her well-being and has provided additional information on her medical history and medications.
