  "age": "58",
  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Ms. Dorr is a 58-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She states that the pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is a dull, aching sensation located in the center of her chest. She rates the pain as a 7/10 in severity. She denies any associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or radiation of the pain. She admits to occasional heartburn and has been taking over-the-counter antacids with relief. She denies any recent trauma or heavy lifting. There is no known precipitating factor for the pain. She did have a similar episode of chest pain approximately 6 months ago which resolved spontaneously. Given her history of occasional heartburn, I am concerned about possible cardiac etiology of her symptoms.",
