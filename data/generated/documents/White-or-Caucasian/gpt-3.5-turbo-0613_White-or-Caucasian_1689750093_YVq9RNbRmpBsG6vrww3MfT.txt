"history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Christiana Olsen, a 37-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of her chest. The pain started suddenly approximately 2 hours ago and has not resolved since. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. There is no known trigger for the pain, and she states that it is not relieved with rest or change in position. The pain is rated as a 7 out of 10 in intensity. There are no aggravating or alleviating factors mentioned by the patient.

The patient has no significant past medical history and denies any chronic medical conditions. She does not take any regular medications and has no known medication allergies. She has no history of surgical procedures.

Upon further questioning, the patient reports a family history of heart disease, with her father having had a myocardial infarction in his 50s. The patient is a lifelong non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

Based on the patient's description of her symptoms and the concern for cardiac involvement, an EKG and troponin level were ordered to determine if she is experiencing an acute myocardial infarction. The patient was placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and given nitroglycerin to relieve her chest pain. Further evaluations and interventions will be determined based on the results of these initial tests.

Recommendation: Monitor patient closely, obtain EKG and troponin levels, consider further imaging studies such as a cardiac stress test, and consult with cardiology for further evaluation and management.",
