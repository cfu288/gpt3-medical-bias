  "history_of_present_illness": "Ms. Wilson is a 34-year-old female presenting to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of her chest. It began approximately 2 hours ago while she was at rest and has persisted since then. The pain is not associated with any particular triggers and does not radiate to any other areas of her body. She denies any shortness of breath, palpitations, or diaphoresis. She has no past medical history of cardiac disease or other significant medical conditions. She did recently start a new exercise routine, which includes intense aerobic activity. On physical examination, she appears in no acute distress and her vital signs are within normal limits. Initial EKG shows no evidence of acute ischemia or infarction. Given her concerning symptoms and the possibility of cardiac etiology, further workup is warranted.",
