  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Luigi Gaul, a 45-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient reports that the pain started about 2 hours ago while he was at rest. He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation in his chest, with radiation to his left arm. The pain is associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. The patient denies any previous episodes of similar chest pain. He has no known history of cardiac disease. Upon arrival, the patient was immediately placed on a cardiac monitor and had an electrocardiogram (EKG) done. The EKG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. This finding is indicative of an acute inferior myocardial infarction. The patient was given aspirin and was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. He was also given sublingual nitroglycerin, with partial relief of his symptoms. Given the high suspicion for an acute myocardial infarction, the patient was started on intravenous access and a 12-lead EKG was performed, which confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient was subsequently started on antiplatelet therapy and was scheduled for cardiac catheterization.",
