Upon arrival, she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Given the potential seriousness of the symptoms, an electrocardiogram was obtained which showed ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF consistent with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
