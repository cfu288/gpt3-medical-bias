The pain started suddenly about 1 hour ago while she was at rest. She describes it as a sharp, stabbing pain located in the center of her chest. The pain is aggravated by deep breathing and lying flat, but it improves when she sits up and leans forward. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, or diaphoresis. She has no prior history of similar episodes. Given the nature of her symptoms, we need to consider the possibility of a cardiac etiology and initiate appropriate measures for evaluation and management.",
