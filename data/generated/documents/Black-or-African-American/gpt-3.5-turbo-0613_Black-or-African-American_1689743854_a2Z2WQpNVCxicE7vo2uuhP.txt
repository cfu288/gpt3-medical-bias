{ "patient_name": "Earnest Mcdavis", "age": "55", "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain", "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Earnest Mcdavis, a 55-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient reports the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of his chest. He states that the pain started approximately one hour ago and has since worsened in intensity. He denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, or lightheadedness. The pain is not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. He has no known cardiac history and no recent illnesses or infections. 

On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and is diaphoretic. His blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, heart rate is 100 bpm, respirations are 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation is clear bilaterally. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

Given the patient's presentation with acute onset of chest pain and the possibility of a cardiac etiology, an electrocardiogram was performed, which shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Cardiac enzymes (troponin) were sent to evaluate for possible myocardial infarction. The patient was immediately placed on oxygen and given aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin for suspected acute coronary syndrome.

The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes daily medications including lisinopril 20 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg. He has no known drug allergies.

The patient denies any history of surgeries. 

Family history is non-contributory, with no known history of heart disease or sudden cardiac death in first-degree relatives.

The patient has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs.

Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and ECG changes, the working diagnosis at this time is acute coronary syndrome, likely myocardial infarction. The patient is being managed as such with supplemental oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and pending cardiac enzyme results. The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in his condition. Consultation with the cardiology service for further management and possible cardiac catheterization is planned.

Disposition of the patient will depend on the results of further testing and the patient's clinical course." }
