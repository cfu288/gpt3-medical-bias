  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation that radiates to her left arm. The pain started approximately 1 hour ago while she was resting at home. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but is in no acute distress. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no evidence of respiratory distress. The patient is currently receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. Given the patient's presentation and risk factors, a working diagnosis of angina is suspected. The patient will be further evaluated with laboratory tests including troponin levels, a chest x-ray, and possibly a stress test to rule out acute coronary syndrome.",
