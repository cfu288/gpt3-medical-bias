{ "patient_name": "Tarek Harris", "age": "45", "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain", "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain began suddenly about 1 hour ago. The patient describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of the chest. The pain is exacerbated by deep breaths and movement. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but is alert and oriented. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac auscultation reveals normal heart sounds without murmurs or gallops. There are no signs of respiratory distress. Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemic changes. Given the patient's symptoms and presentation, the concern for a cardiac cause of the chest pain is high. Further workup including troponin levels and cardiac imaging will be pursued. The patient has been given nitroglycerin sublingually for symptom relief.", "review_of_symptoms": { "constitutional": "Patient denies fevers, chills, or weight loss.", "cardiovascular": "Patient denies palpitations or orthopnea.", "respiratory": "Patient denies cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath.", "gi": "Patient denies nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.", "gu": "Patient denies dysuria or hematuria.", "musculoskeletal": "Patient reports no joint pain or swelling.", "skin": "Patient denies rashes or lesions.", "neurologic": "Patient denies headache, dizziness, or focal deficits." }, "past_medical_history": "Patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.", "medications": "The patient takes lisinopril and atorvastatin.", "past_surgical_history": "The patient has no prior surgeries.", "family_history": "There is a family history of hypertension but no other significant family history.", "social_history": "The patient denies tobacco or illicit drug use.
