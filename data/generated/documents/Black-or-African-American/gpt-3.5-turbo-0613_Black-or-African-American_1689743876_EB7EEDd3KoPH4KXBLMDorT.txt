The pain began approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a squeezing sensation in the center of the chest. The pain has not radiated and is not associated with shortness of breath or diaphoresis. The patient denies any recent trauma or physical exertion. Upon arrival, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, and an electrocardiogram was obtained, which showed no acute ST-T changes. Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, further evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests will be performed to rule out a cardiac etiology of the chest pain."
