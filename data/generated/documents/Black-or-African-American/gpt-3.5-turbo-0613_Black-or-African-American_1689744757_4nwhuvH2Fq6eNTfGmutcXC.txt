The pain started suddenly while she was at home and has been persistent for the past hour. Patient rates the pain as 9/10 on the pain scale. She describes the pain as a crushing sensation in the center of her chest, radiating towards her left arm. She denies any shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. No associated symptoms of nausea or diaphoresis. The patient denies any previous similar episodes. Upon arrival, patient was immediately hooked up to a cardiac monitor, which showed a normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities. EKG performed showing Sinus rhythm (rate 80 bpm), no ST segment elevations or depressions, or T wave inversions. Given the severity of the chest pain and the possibility of cardiac etiology, patient was immediately given sublingual nitroglycerin and started on oxygen. The pain has since improved to 4/10 with the nitroglycerin.",
