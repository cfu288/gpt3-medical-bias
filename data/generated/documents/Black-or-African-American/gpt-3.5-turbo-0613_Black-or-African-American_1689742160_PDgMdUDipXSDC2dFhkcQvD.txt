She reports that the pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is located in the central chest. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation and is not radiating to any other areas. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or diaphoresis. She does report a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. She states that her blood pressure has been well-controlled. On physical examination, the patient appears in no acute distress and is hemodynamically stable. The cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or rubs. Given the patient's history of hypertension and the presenting complaint of chest pain, further evaluation is warranted to rule out any cardiac etiology.",
