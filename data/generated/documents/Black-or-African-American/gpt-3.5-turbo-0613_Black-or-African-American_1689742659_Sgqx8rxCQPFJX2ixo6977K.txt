  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Richelle Clark, is a 42-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. 

The chest pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a squeezing sensation in the center of the chest. The pain radiates to the left arm and jaw. The patient also reports feeling short of breath and nauseous. She denies any associated symptoms such as palpitations or diaphoresis. 

The patient has no known history of heart disease or risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, or diabetes. She has never experienced chest pain like this before. She came to the emergency department because the pain was not relieved with rest and she is concerned about her symptoms. 

On physical examination, the patient appears in moderate distress, holding her chest. She is pale and diaphoretic. Vital signs are as follows: 
- Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg
- Heart rate: 110 bpm
- Respiratory rate: 20 bpm
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

Given the patient's symptoms and the possibility of acute coronary syndrome, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. These findings are suggestive of an inferior wall myocardial infarction. 

The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen via nasal cannula. A heparin drip was also initiated. The cardiology team was consulted, and the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The patient's condition is stable at this time, and she is being closely monitored. Further updates will be provided as necessary.",
