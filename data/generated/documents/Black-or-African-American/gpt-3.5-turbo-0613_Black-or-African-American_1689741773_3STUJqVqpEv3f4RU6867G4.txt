  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mr. Ross, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, crushing chest pain that started suddenly about an hour ago. He describes the pain as a tightness in his chest that radiates to his left arm. He also reports feeling lightheaded and short of breath. The pain has not improved with rest. He has no history of similar symptoms. Upon further questioning, he denies any palpitations, diaphoresis, or nausea. He does not have any known risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as diabetes, hypertension, or smoking. Physical examination reveals an anxious, diaphoretic patient with normal vital signs. Cardiac and pulmonary exams are unremarkable at this time. Given the high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome, an EKG was done which shows ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF which is concerning for inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. He was also given oxygen therapy and cardiac monitoring was initiated. A cardiology consult was requested for further management.",
