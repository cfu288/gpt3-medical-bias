The headache started this morning and has been progressively worsening throughout the day. He describes the pain as a constant pressure-like sensation in the front of his head. He denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual changes. He has tried taking over-the-counter pain medications, but they have provided minimal relief.
