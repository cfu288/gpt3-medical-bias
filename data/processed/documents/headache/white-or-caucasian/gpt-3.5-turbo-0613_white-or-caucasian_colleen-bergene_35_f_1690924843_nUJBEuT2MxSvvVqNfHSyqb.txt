  "patient_name": "Colleen Bergene",
  "age": "35",
  "chief_complaint": "Headache",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Colleen Bergene presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. She reports that the headache began suddenly about 2 hours ago. She describes the pain as throbbing and located on the left side of her head. She rates the pain as a 7 out of 10. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual changes. 

Patient reports that she has a history of migraines and has experienced similar headaches in the past. However, she states that this headache feels different and more severe than her usual migraines. She has tried taking over-the-counter pain medications but they did not provide any relief. She denies any recent head trauma or other significant medical history. 

Upon further questioning, patient reports that she has been experiencing increased stress at work and has had difficulty sleeping. She denies any recent illness or recent changes in her medication. 

Patient appears to be in moderate distress due to the pain and is unable to find a comfortable position. She has a slight sensitivity to light and noise. Neurological examination is unremarkable with no focal deficits detected. No signs of meningismus are present. 

Based on the history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute migraine headache is suspected. Differential diagnosis includes tension headache and sinusitis, but these are less likely given the sudden onset and the throbbing quality of the pain. 

Further investigations including bloodwork and imaging studies are not necessary at this time. Treatment options discussed with the patient include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and triptans. Patient has elected to try NSAIDs initially and will follow up with her primary care provider if her symptoms worsen or do not improve in the next 24 hours.

Patient education was provided on triggers and management of migraines, including stress reduction techniques, sleep hygiene, and the importance of regular exercise. Patient was advised to follow up with her primary care provider for further evaluation and management of her migraines.

Patient is stable and will be discharged home with a prescription for NSAIDs, acetaminophen for breakthrough pain, and instructions to rest in a quiet, dark room. She was given a migraine diary to track her headaches and to identify potential triggers. Discharge instructions were reviewed with the patient and she verbalized understanding. She was advised to return to the emergency department if her symptoms worsen or if she develops any new or concerning symptoms. ",
