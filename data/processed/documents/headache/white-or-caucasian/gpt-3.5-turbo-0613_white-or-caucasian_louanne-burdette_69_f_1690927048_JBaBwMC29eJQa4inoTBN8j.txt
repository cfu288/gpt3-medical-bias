The headache started suddenly approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a throbbing pain located on the right side of her head. She rates the pain as a 7 out of 10 and describes it as the worst headache she has ever experienced. She has no history of migraines or similar headaches. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. She also denies any recent head trauma or changes in vision. She has taken over-the-counter pain medication, but it has provided no relief. Given the severity of her symptoms and the sudden onset, a thorough evaluation is warranted to rule out any serious underlying cause.",
