Plan:
1. Conduct a thorough physical examination, including a neurological examination, to assess the patient's overall condition
2. Order a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel to assess for any abnormalities
3. Consider obtaining a head CT scan to rule out any underlying structural causes of the headache
4. Prescribe a stronger pain medication, such as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or a triptan, to provide more effective relief for the headache
5. Advise the patient to rest in a quiet, dark room and to avoid triggers such as bright lights and loud noises
6. Educate the patient on lifestyle modifications to help prevent future headaches, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, managing stress, and staying hydrated
7. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess the patient's symptoms and adjust the treatment plan if necessary

Please note that the above plan is a preliminary assessment and further diagnostic testing or consultation may be necessary based on the examination findings. The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in symptoms or worsening of the condition.
