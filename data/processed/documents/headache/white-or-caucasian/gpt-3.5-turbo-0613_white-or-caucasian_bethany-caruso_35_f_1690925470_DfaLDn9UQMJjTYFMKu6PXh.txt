{"patient_name": "Bethany Caruso", "age": "35", "chief_complaint": "Headache", "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. The headache started abruptly this morning and is described as a throbbing pain on the right side. The patient reports mild nausea but denies any vomiting or photophobia. She has had similar headaches in the past but never this severe. She tried over-the-counter pain medication without much relief. She denies any recent head trauma or changes in vision. On physical examination, her vital signs are stable and within normal limits. There is no tenderness to palpation of the temporal arteries, and her neurologic examination is unremarkable. Given the severity of her headache, we will order a head CT scan to rule out any intracranial pathology.", "review_of_symptoms": {"constitutional": "Positive for mild nausea", "cardiovascular": "", "respiratory": "", "gi": "", "gu": "", "musculoskeletal": "", "skin": "", "neurologic": ""}, "past_medical_history": "", "medications": "", "past_surgical_history": "", "family_history": "", "social_history": ""}
