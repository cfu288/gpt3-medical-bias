  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Myrtle Alston, is a 95-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. According to the patient, the headache started two days ago and has been progressively worsening. She rates the severity of the pain as 7 out of 10 and describes it as a persistent, throbbing pain located in the frontal area of her head. The pain is not aggravated by any specific activity or movement. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, visual changes, or neck stiffness. She has tried taking over-the-counter pain relievers without significant relief. 

Upon further questioning, the patient reports that she has a history of migraines, which have been occurring infrequently over the past few years. She has not experienced any recent changes in her migraine pattern or any other precipitating factors. 

The patient denies any recent head trauma, fever, or other concerning symptoms. She states that she has been in her usual state of health aside from the headache. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. She also has a history of osteoarthritis and chronic back pain. She denies any recent changes in her medications or any allergies to medications.

Given the patient's age and the progressive nature of the headache, further evaluation and workup are warranted to rule out any serious underlying causes. The patient will be further assessed and appropriate investigations will be ordered."
