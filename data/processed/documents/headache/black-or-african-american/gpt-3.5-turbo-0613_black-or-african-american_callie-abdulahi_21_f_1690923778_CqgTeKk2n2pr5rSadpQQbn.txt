  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Callie Abdulahi, a 21-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. She reports the headache started suddenly about 2 hours ago and is described as a throbbing pain on the right side of her head. She rates the pain as a 7 out of 10 and states that it is the worst headache she has ever experienced. The headache is accompanied by nausea but no vomiting. She denies any recent trauma or head injury. 
  Based on her history, she has no past medical history of migraines or other significant medical conditions. She denies any recent illnesses or infections. 
  Upon physical examination, her vital signs are within normal limits, and she appears well. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits. 
  I will order further diagnostic tests including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and a head CT scan to evaluate for any possible underlying causes of her headache. In the meantime, I will prescribe her acetaminophen for pain relief and provide her with advice on headache management and potential triggers.",
