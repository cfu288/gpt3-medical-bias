  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Natasha Pierre, a 62-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. The headache started suddenly earlier today and is described as a throbbing pain on the right side of her head. The pain is severe and is associated with nausea. She states that she has never experienced a headache like this before. She denies any recent trauma or changes in medications. She also denies any other associated symptoms, such as vision changes, fever, or neck stiffness. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and she takes medication for that. On physical examination, the patient appears in distress, holding her head and covering her eyes. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits. Given the sudden onset of severe headache in a patient with no previous history of migraines, further evaluation is needed to rule out any serious underlying cause.",
