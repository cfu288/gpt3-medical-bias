  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient Lakisha Roberts, a 44-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. She states that the headache started suddenly this morning and is located in the frontal region. The pain is described as dull and throbbing, with a severity of 6 out of 10. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound. She has not experienced any recent head trauma or falls. She is otherwise healthy and denies any past medical history of migraines or other frequent headaches. 

The patient denies any recent changes in medication or recent illness. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. 
    
During the interview, the patient mentions that she has been experiencing increased stress at work and in her personal life, which she believes may be contributing to her headache. 

On physical examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination is normal without any focal deficits. There are no signs of trauma or abnormalities on inspection of the head and neck. 

Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is tension headache. However, further investigations may be required to rule out other causes such as migraine or sinusitis. 

The patient has been advised to take over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for relief of symptoms. Additionally, stress management techniques such as relaxation exercises and lifestyle modifications have been discussed with the patient. The patient has been advised to follow up with her primary care physician for further evaluation and management if the headache persists or worsens.
