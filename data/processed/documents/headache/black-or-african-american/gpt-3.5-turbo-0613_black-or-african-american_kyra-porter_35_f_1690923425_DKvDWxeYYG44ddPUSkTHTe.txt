  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Kyra Porter, a 35-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. She describes the headache as a dull, throbbing pain that started this morning and has been gradually worsening throughout the day. She rates the intensity of the pain as a 7 out of 10 and states that it is localized to the frontal region.

  The patient denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or photophobia. She reports that she has never experienced a headache of this severity before and is concerned about the sudden onset.

  Upon further questioning, the patient reveals that she has been under significant stress lately due to work-related issues. She admits to not getting enough sleep and consuming excessive amounts of caffeine. She denies any recent head trauma or changes in vision. There is no history of migraine or other neurological disorders in the past.

  Vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 98.6Â°F. Physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of neurological deficits.

  Based on the history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is a tension headache. However, a thorough evaluation and further investigations will be performed to rule out other possible causes of the headache.

  Treatment for the headache includes rest, adequate hydration, analgesics, and stress reduction techniques. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in symptoms and will be provided with appropriate follow-up instructions.",
