{"patient_name": "Thurman Johnson", "age": "86", "chief_complaint": "Headache", "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Thurman Johnson, an 86-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a complaint of headache. The headache started yesterday morning and has been persistent since then. The patient describes the headache as a dull ache in the frontal area of his head. He rates the pain as a 6 out of 10 on a numerical rating scale. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. He also denies any recent head trauma or changes in his medications. Throughout the past day, the headache has not improved with over-the-counter pain relievers. Given the persistence and severity of the headache, the patient decided to seek medical attention. During the examination, no focal neurological deficits were noted. Vital signs are stable, and the patient's general appearance is consistent with his stated age. Due to the patient's age and the atypical presentation of the headache, further evaluation and investigation are warranted to determine the underlying cause of the headache.", "review_of_symptoms": {"constitutional": "", "cardiovascular": "", "respiratory": "", "gi": "", "gu": "", "musculoskeletal": "", "skin": "", "neurologic": ""}, "past_medical_history": "", "medications": "", "past_surgical_history": "", "family_history": "", "social_history": ""}
