  "history_of_present_illness": "Ms. Mars presents to the emergency department with a complaint of severe headache. The headache started suddenly about 4 hours ago and is described as a throbbing pain on the right side of her head. She rates the pain as a 8 out of 10 and reports that it is the worst headache she has ever experienced. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, changes in vision, or weakness. She has tried taking over-the-counter pain medication but it has not provided any relief. Given the severity of her symptoms and the sudden onset, I have ordered further investigations to determine the cause.",
