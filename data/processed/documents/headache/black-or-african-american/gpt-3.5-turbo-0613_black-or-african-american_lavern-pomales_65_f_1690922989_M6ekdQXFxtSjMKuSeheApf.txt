  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Lavern Pomales, is a 65-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of headache. According to the patient, the headache started suddenly about 2 hours ago. She describes it as a throbbing pain located in the front of her head. She rates the intensity of the headache as a 7 out of 10. The pain is constant and is not relieved by rest or over-the-counter pain medications. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or changes in vision. The patient reports no recent head trauma or history of migraines. She states that she has been experiencing occasional headaches in the past, but they were never as severe as this one.  On physical examination, the patient appears generally well and in no acute distress. Her vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6Â°F. Neurologic examination reveals no focal deficits. Cranial nerves are intact and pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. There are no signs of meningeal irritation. The patient exhibits no abnormalities on auscultation of the heart, lungs, and abdomen. The musculoskeletal and skin exams are unremarkable. Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient's headache appears to be primary in nature. However, further evaluation is warranted to rule out any secondary causes. A complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and non-contrast head CT scan will be ordered to further assess the patient and rule out any underlying pathology.",
