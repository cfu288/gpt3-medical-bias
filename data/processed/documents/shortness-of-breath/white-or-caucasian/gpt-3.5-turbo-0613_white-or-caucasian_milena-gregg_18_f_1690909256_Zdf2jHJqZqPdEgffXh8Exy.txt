She denies any recent illness, fever, cough, chest pain, or leg swelling. There is no history of similar episodes in the past. She states that she has no known allergies. Upon examination, the patient is in no acute distress. She appears well-nourished and in no respiratory distress. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, skin, and neurologic systems is within normal limits. The patient reports no constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, or fatigue. Given her age and lack of significant findings on examination, she is being evaluated for alternative causes of shortness of breath such as anxiety or hyperventilation syndrome. Additional diagnostic tests will be ordered to further evaluate her condition.",
