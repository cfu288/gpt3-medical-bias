  "patient_name": "Clement Hamm",
  "age": "32",
  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mr. Clement Hamm, a 32-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that his symptoms began suddenly this morning while he was at rest. He describes the shortness of breath as moderate in severity and associated with mild chest tightness. He denies any cough, fever, wheezing, or recent illness. The patient denies any history of similar symptoms in the past. 

  Upon further questioning, the patient admits to a smoking history of 10 pack-years. He states that he used to smoke cigarettes but quit 1 year ago. He does not have any known allergies. The patient denies any recent travel, exposure to sick contacts, or any recent significant changes in his surroundings or environment.

  The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
  - Blood pressure: 130/80 mmHg
  - Heart rate: 84 beats per minute
  - Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
  - Oxygen saturation: 97% on room air

  Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally with no wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. The patient's chest is non-tender to palpation, and there are no signs of respiratory distress. Cardiac auscultation reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. 

  Given the patient's chief complaint and history, the differential diagnosis includes:
  1. Pulmonary embolism
  2. Pneumonia
  3. Asthma exacerbation
  4. Anxiety

  Diagnostic workup is initiated with a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, arterial blood gas analysis, and a chest x-ray. These tests will help to rule out primary cardiac or pulmonary causes of the patient's symptoms. A D-dimer test will also be ordered to assess for the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. The patient will be monitored and reassessed in the emergency department for any changes in his symptoms or vital signs.

  The plan for the patient includes:
  1. Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%.
  2. Order a 12-lead electrocardiogram to evaluate for any signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias.
  3. Initiate thromboprophylaxis with subcutaneous enoxaparin to prevent possible venous thromboembolism.
  4. Consider nebulized bronchodilator therapy if the patient's symptoms worsen.
  5. Provide reassurance and education regarding potential causes of the patient's symptoms and the importance of follow-up.

  Further management will depend on the results of the diagnostic tests and the patient's response to initial interventions."
