The patient has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been on oxygen therapy at home. He states that he has been compliant with his home oxygen therapy, but it has not been relieving his symptoms. He denies any recent illnesses or infections. Upon initial evaluation, the patient appears to be in moderate respiratory distress with visible use of accessory muscles and prolonged expiration. Lung auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with crackles heard at the bases. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. EKG and cardiac enzymes have been ordered to rule out acute coronary syndrome."
