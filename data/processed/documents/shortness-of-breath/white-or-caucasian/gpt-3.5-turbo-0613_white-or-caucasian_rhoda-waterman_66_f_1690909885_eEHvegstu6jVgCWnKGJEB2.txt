  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath has gradually worsened over the past few weeks and is now interfering with her daily activities. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. She has a history of asthma and has been using her rescue inhaler more frequently without relief. She denies any recent upper respiratory infections or exposure to allergens. She denies any history of heart disease or other significant medical problems. On physical examination, the patient appears in mild distress, with increased work of breathing. She has decreased breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse wheezing. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and she is maintaining oxygen saturation above 95% on room air. An EKG is obtained, which shows sinus rhythm without evidence of acute ischemia. Given her history of asthma and the acuity of her symptoms, a diagnosis of exacerbation of asthma is made. She is treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium, which leads to significant improvement in her symptoms. She is discharged home with a prescription for an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroids and a short course of oral corticosteroids."
