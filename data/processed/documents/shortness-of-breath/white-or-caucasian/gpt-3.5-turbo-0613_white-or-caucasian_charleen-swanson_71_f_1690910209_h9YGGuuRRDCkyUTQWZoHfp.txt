  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Charleen Swanson, is a 71-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath began suddenly earlier this morning and has been worsening since then. She denies any associated chest pain or cough. She also denies any recent illness or trauma. She reports that she has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases and the presence of crackles. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Based on her presentation and examination findings, the patient is suspected to have acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but other causes such as pneumonia or heart failure should be considered. Further workup, including chest x-ray and blood tests, should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",
