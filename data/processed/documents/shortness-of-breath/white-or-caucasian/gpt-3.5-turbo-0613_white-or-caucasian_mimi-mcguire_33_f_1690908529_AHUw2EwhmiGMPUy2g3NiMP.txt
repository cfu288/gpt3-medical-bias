  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the Emergency Department with chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that she began experiencing difficulty breathing approximately one hour ago while climbing stairs. She describes the shortness of breath as sudden in onset and progressively worsening. The patient denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She reports no past medical history of respiratory conditions or surgeries. She denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. Initial assessment reveals tachypnea and use of accessory muscles for breathing. Oxygen saturation is 89% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally with crackles. Given the acuity of the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to pneumonia is suspected. The patient is being treated with supplemental oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.",
