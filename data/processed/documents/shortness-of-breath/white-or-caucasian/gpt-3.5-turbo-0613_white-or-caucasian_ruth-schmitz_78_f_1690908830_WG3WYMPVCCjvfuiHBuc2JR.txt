She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about one hour ago and has been progressively worsening. She denies any associated chest pain or palpitations. She also denies any cough, fever, or recent illnesses. She states that she has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. She denies any recent changes in her medications or any known allergies. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is struggling to breathe. She is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. She has decreased breath sounds on auscultation and there are diffuse bilateral rales upon lung examination. Her oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Given the acute onset and progressive worsening of her symptoms, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure is suspected. Further evaluation and treatment will be initiated.",
