{ "patient_name": "Angelica Woods", "age": "22", "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath", "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Angelica Woods, is a 22-year-old female presenting to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath. She states that she has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing over the past few hours. She denies any chest pain, dizziness, or palpitations. She reports no recent infections or traumas. The onset of her symptoms was sudden and she is unable to identify any triggers. She has no known medical conditions and does not take any regular medications. She denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. On physical examination, the patient is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. She appears anxious and uncomfortable. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles are appreciated. The patient's vital signs are otherwise within normal limits. Given the patient's acute onset of shortness of breath, a differential diagnosis of asthma exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax should be considered. Further diagnostic workup will include a chest X-ray, arterial blood gas analysis, and a D-dimer test. Treatment will focus on relieving the patient's symptoms and addressing the underlying cause. The patient will be monitored closely for any worsening respiratory distress and will receive supplemental oxygen as needed." , "review_of_symptoms" : { "constitutional" : "The patient denies any fever, chills, weight loss or night sweats.", "cardiovascular" : "No chest pain, palpitations or edema.", "respiratory" : "The patient reports shortness of breath as her chief complaint.", "gi" : "No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or changes in bowel movements.", "gu" : "No dysuria, frequency, or hematuria.", "musculoskeletal" : "No joint pain or stiffness.", "skin" : "No rashes or lesions.", "neurologic" : "No headaches, dizziness or changes in vision." }, "past_medical_history": "", "medications": "", "past_surgical_history": "", "family_history": "", "social_history": "" }
