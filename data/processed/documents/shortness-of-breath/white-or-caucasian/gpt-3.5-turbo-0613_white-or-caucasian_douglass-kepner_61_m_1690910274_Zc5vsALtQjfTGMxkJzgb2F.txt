The patient reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly and has been getting worse over the past few hours. He denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. The patient has a history of smoking and reports a smoking history of one pack per day for the past 40 years. He also has a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in mild respiratory distress, with tachypnea and using accessory muscles to breathe. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and inspiratory crackles in the bases. Cardiac examination is unremarkable. The patient's vital signs are stable except for tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, further evaluation is warranted to determine the cause of his shortness of breath.",
