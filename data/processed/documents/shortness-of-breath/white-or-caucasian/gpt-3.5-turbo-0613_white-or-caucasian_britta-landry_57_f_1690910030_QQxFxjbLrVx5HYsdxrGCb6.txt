  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Britta Landry, a 57-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly this morning and has been progressively worsening throughout the day. She denies any chest pain, fever, cough, or other associated symptoms. She states that she has a history of asthma, which has been well-controlled without any recent exacerbations. She admits to occasional tobacco use but denies any recent smoking. Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and is using her accessory respiratory muscles to aid in breathing. Her lung sounds are decreased with inspiratory crackles heard bilaterally. She is able to speak full sentences but reports feeling very breathless. Pulse oximetry reveals an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Given the patient's history of asthma and acute onset of dyspnea, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is suspected. However, other conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or congestive heart failure need to be considered. The patient will be further evaluated with a chest x-ray, blood tests including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram."
