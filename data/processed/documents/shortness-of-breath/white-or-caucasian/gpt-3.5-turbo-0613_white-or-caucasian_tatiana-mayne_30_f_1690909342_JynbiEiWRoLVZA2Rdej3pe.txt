{ "patient_name": "Tatiana Mayne", "age": "30", "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath", "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the Emergency Department with complaints of shortness of breath. Symptoms started approximately 2 hours ago and have been progressively worsening. Patient reports no associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She denies any recent sick contacts or travel. This is the first time she has experienced symptoms like this. Patient states that she has a history of asthma, but has not required any medications or hospitalizations for it in the past. Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, she had a room air oxygen saturation of 92%. She was given supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute, which improved her oxygen saturation to 96%. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and wheezing bilaterally. Given the patient's acute onset of symptoms and history of asthma, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is suspected. Differential diagnosis also includes respiratory tract infection and pneumothorax. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests, will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. The patient will be initiated on nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids for treatment of her asthma exacerbation. Close monitoring of her respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and response to treatment will be performed.
