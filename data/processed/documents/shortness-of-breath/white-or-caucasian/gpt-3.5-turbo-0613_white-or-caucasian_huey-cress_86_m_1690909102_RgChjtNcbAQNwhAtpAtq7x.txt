The patient states that he has never experienced similar symptoms in the past. He reports that he has a history of hypertension and takes medications for it. He denies any recent illness or trauma.

His vital signs were as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37.0°C), heart rate 92 beats per minute, blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute, and his oxygen saturation improved to 94%.
