She reports that the shortness of breath began abruptly earlier this evening and has been worsening since then. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She also denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. On further questioning, she reports a history of asthma but states that she has not had any recent exacerbations. She reports no other significant medical history or recent changes in her medications. She denies any known drug allergies. Upon examination, the patient appears comfortable at rest, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. She is able to speak in full sentences and does not appear cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the right base. The patient's vital signs are stable at this time. Given her history of asthma and the unilateral decreased breath sounds, a pneumothorax is suspected. Chest X-ray and further evaluation will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.",
