Patient reports no recent travel or sick contacts. She states that she has a history of asthma but has been compliant with her inhalers. Upon further questioning, the patient reports no recent changes to her medication regimen or exposure to known triggers for her asthma. Initial examination reveals increased work of breathing with decreased breath sounds on auscultation. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Patient is sitting upright and appears anxious. Given her symptoms and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is suspected. Patient has been placed on supplemental oxygen, started on nebulized albuterol treatments, and given a systemic corticosteroid.
