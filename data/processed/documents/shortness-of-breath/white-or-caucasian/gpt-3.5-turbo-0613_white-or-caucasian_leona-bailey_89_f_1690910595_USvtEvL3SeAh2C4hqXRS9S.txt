The patient reports that she has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing over the past few days, which has been accompanied by coughing and wheezing. She denies any chest pain, fever, or chills. The patient states that she has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been prescribed an inhaler, which she has been using as directed. She reports no recent changes in her medication or any new exposures to allergens or respiratory irritants. Upon examination, the patient appears to be in moderate respiratory distress, with increased work of breathing and decreased breath sounds on auscultation. The patient's oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Considering the patient's history of COPD and the presence of new-onset dyspnea, a diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD is likely.",
