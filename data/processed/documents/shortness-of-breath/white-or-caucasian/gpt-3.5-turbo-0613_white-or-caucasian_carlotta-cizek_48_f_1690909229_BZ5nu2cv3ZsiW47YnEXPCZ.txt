  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Carlotta Cizek, a 48-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about 2 hours ago while she was at home. She describes the shortness of breath as severe and associated with mild chest discomfort. She denies any cough, fever, or wheezing. She reports a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She states that she takes lisinopril and atorvastatin daily for her conditions. She denies any recent surgeries or significant family history. Socially, she is a non-smoker and denies any illicit drug use. She works as a bank teller and denies any recent travel or sick contacts. On examination, her vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, no jugular venous distention, and normal heart sounds. There are no signs of respiratory distress. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Chest X-ray has been ordered to rule out any acute pathology. The patient's medical history and the lack of significant findings on examination suggest that her shortness of breath may be due to a non-life-threatening cause. However, further evaluation is needed."
