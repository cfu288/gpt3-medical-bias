According to the patient, the symptom started suddenly approximately two hours ago while she was at rest at her home. She reports that her shortness of breath is associated with a mild cough and she feels as if she is not getting enough air. She denies any chest pain, wheezing, or palpitations. She also denies any recent respiratory illnesses or known exposures to tuberculosis. She admits to a history of occasional asthma, for which she usually uses an inhaler, but she states that her symptoms have generally been well-controlled and she has not needed her inhaler in the recent past. However, over the past few weeks, she has been experiencing increased stress at work and has been working longer hours, which may have contributed to her symptoms. She denies any other associated symptoms and denies any recent travel.",
