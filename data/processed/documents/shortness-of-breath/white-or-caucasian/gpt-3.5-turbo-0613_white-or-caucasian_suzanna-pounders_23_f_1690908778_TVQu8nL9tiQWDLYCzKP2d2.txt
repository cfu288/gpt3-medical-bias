She reports that she has been experiencing difficulty breathing for the past 24 hours. She describes the shortness of breath as sudden in onset and worsening with activity. She denies any chest pain or palpitations. She also denies any history of respiratory infections or allergies. She has no known medical conditions and takes no medications. She denies any recent travel or exposure to sick individuals. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in moderate distress. She is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with crackles. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Given her symptoms and physical examination findings, a further workup is warranted to determine the cause of her shortness of breath.",
