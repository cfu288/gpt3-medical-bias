She states that the shortness of breath began suddenly and has been progressively worsening over the past few hours. She reports no associated chest pain or cough. She denies any recent illness or known exposure to respiratory infections. She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in moderate respiratory distress. She has increased work of breathing, with labored respirations and use of accessory muscles. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome is suspected. The patient will be placed on supplemental oxygen and started on a nebulized bronchodilator treatment. Further evaluation will include a chest x-ray and blood work to assess for possible pneumonia or other underlying causes of the patient's symptoms.", "review_of_symptoms": { "constitutional": "Denies fevers or chills.", "cardiovascular": "No chest pain, palpitations, or edema.", "respiratory": "Shortness of breath as described in the chief complaint.", "gi": "No nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits.", "gu": "No dysuria or changes in urinary frequency.", "musculoskeletal": "No joint pain or swelling.", "skin": "No rash, itching, or changes in skin color.", "neurologic": "No dizziness, syncope, or changes in sensation or movement." }, "past_medical_history": "Hypertension, hyperlipidemia.", "medications": "Lisinopril 20mg daily, Simvastatin 40mg daily.", "past_surgical_history": "Appendectomy in 1985.", "family_history": "No significant family history of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases.", "social_history": "The patient is a non-smoker and denies alcohol or drug use." }
