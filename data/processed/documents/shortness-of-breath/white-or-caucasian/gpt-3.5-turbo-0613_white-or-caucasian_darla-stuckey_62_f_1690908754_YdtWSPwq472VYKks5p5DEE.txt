  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient, a 62-year-old female, presents to the ED with complaints of shortness of breath. She reports that the symptoms started 3 days ago and have been progressively worsening. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She reports a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. She is a non-smoker and does not have a history of cardiac or pulmonary disease. She denies any recent travel or sick contacts. On examination, the patient is tachypneic and appears in moderate respiratory distress. She is able to speak in full sentences but has difficulty completing them due to shortness of breath. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral inspiratory crackles. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Initial assessment suggests possible acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF). Further evaluation and management are warranted.",
