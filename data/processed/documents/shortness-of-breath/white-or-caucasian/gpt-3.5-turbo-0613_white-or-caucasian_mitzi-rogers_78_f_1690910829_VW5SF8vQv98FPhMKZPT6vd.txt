  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mitzi Rogers, a 78-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about 2 hours ago and has been progressively worsening. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. She states that she has a history of congestive heart failure and is currently taking medication for it. The patient reports that she has been adherent to her medications and has not experienced any recent exacerbations of her symptoms. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is breathing rapidly. She has decreased breath sounds and crackles bilaterally on lung auscultation. The patient's vital signs are as follows: heart rate 100 beats per minute, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Considering the patient's history of congestive heart failure and acute onset of shortness of breath, concern for worsening heart failure and possible pulmonary edema is raised. EKG and chest X-ray have been ordered to further assess the patient's condition."
