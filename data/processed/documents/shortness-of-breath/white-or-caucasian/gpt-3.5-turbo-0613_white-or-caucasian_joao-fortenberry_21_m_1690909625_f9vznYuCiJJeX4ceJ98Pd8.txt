The patient states that he has a history of asthma but has been non-compliant with his inhaler. He also reports that he recently returned from a vacation to a high-altitude area. On physical examination, the patient is tachypneic with increased work of breathing. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the bases of the lungs. He appears anxious and is using accessory muscles of respiration. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Due to the patient's acuity and concern for impending respiratory failure, he is promptly placed on supplemental oxygen via mask at 6L/min.",
