The patient reports that she has been experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past few hours. She states that she is unable to take deep breaths and feels like she is not getting enough air. The onset of symptoms was sudden and there are no clear triggers or alleviating factors. She denies any chest pain, cough, fever, or recent illness. She has no known history of respiratory conditions or allergies. The patient is a non-smoker and does not have a history of asthma or other lung diseases. She denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. Initial assessment reveals tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.
