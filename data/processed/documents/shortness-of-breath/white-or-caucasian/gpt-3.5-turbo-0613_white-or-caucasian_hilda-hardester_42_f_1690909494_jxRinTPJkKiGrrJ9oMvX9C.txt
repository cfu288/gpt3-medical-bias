  "patient_name": "Hilda Hardester",

  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that her symptoms began about 2 days ago and have been progressively worsening. She reports a sensation of difficulty breathing, especially with exertion. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, cough, fever, or lower extremity swelling. She states that she has been experiencing intermittent lightheadedness. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. On physical examination, the patient appears comfortable at rest. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She has decreased breath sounds on auscultation on the right side of her chest and dullness to percussion. She is tachycardic but otherwise has a normal cardiovascular exam. Based on the patient's presentation and examination findings, the working diagnosis is right-sided pleural effusion. She requires further diagnostic workup, including chest x-ray and possibly thoracentesis to confirm the diagnosis and determine the etiology of the effusion. The patient has been provided with supplemental oxygen, and a chest x-ray has been ordered. Pending further evaluation, the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress or worsening condition.",
