{ "patient_name": "Mariela Suciu", "age": "39", "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath", "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mariela Suciu, a 39-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath. She reports that the symptoms started earlier today and have been gradually worsening. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She states that she has a history of asthma and has been using her inhaler as needed. However, today her symptoms did not improve with the use of her inhaler. She also reports feeling lightheaded and fatigued. She denies any recent illness or exposure to sick contacts. On physical examination, the patient appears moderately distressed and is using accessory muscles of respiration. Lung auscultation reveals decreased air entry and scattered wheezes throughout both lung fields. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Given her history of asthma, the symptoms of shortness of breath, and the physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is suspected. However, other causes of shortness of breath, such as pulmonary embolism or pneumonia, will need to be ruled out. The patient will be further evaluated with laboratory tests, including a complete blood count and a chest x-ray, and she will be started on nebulized bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen as needed.
