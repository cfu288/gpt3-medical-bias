  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Simon Wiseman, is a 51-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about an hour ago while he was at home. He describes the shortness of breath as severe and constant, with no alleviating factors. He denies any recent illness or exposure to sick contacts. He also denies any chest pain, cough, fever, or other respiratory symptoms. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no significant past medical history or known allergies. Upon further questioning, he states that he does not smoke and has no history of lung disease. He has also never had any similar episodes of shortness of breath in the past. He denies any recent travel or exposure to chemicals or irritants. The patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6Â°F, heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and bilateral wheezing on auscultation. Given the sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and bilateral wheezing, there is concern for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a new-onset asthma. The patient will be further evaluated with spirometry and pulse oximetry and started on nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as indicated.",
