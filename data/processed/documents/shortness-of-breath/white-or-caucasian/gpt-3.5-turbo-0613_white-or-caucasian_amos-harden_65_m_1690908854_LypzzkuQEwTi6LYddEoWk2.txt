"history_of_present_illness": "Mr. Harden is a 65-year-old male patient who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that he started experiencing this symptom a few hours ago while at rest. He denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. He reports having a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. He also mentions a recent upper respiratory tract infection that resolved a week ago. 
The patient appears anxious and labored breathing. He is able to speak in full sentences. He has stable vital signs on presentation, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute onset of symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to determine the cause of his shortness of breath. A comprehensive physical examination, including auscultation of the lungs and heart, will be performed. Initial management will include supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 90% and obtaining basic laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and chest X-ray.
A respiratory therapist has been notified to assist with the initial management. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in symptoms or vital signs throughout his stay in the emergency department.",
