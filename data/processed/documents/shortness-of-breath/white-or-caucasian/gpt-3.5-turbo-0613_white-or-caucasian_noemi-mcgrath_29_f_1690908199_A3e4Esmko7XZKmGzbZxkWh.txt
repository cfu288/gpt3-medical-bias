  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Noemi Mcgrath, a 29-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with the chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath started this morning and has been progressively worsening. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She also denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. On further evaluation, I noted increased work of breathing with the use of accessory muscles and decreased breath sounds on auscultation of the left lung base. Initial assessment suggests a possible pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The patient appears distressed and in mild respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation is at 89% on room air. She also reports a history of asthma.",
