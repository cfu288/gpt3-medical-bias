  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about an hour ago while she was at rest. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is breathing rapidly with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezing. Given the acute onset of symptoms and the wheezing on exam, the working diagnosis is acute asthma exacerbation. Initial management includes administration of nebulized albuterol and ipratropium and systemic corticosteroids. The patient will be closely monitored for improvement in symptoms and reassessed regularly.",
