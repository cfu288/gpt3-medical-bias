  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Elva Watters, presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reported that she has been experiencing worsening shortness of breath over the past few days. She also reported associated symptoms of cough and wheezing. The patient denied any chest pain or fevers. Upon further questioning, the patient mentioned that she has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been prescribed inhalers for management. However, she admitted to not using her inhalers regularly as prescribed. She also mentioned no recent exacerbations of her COPD symptoms. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress with increased work of breathing. Her oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Breath sounds were diminished bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes. The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and given nebulized bronchodilators. She responded well to the bronchodilator treatment and her oxygen saturation improved to 95%. Given her history of COPD and the acute exacerbation of her symptoms, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD was made.",
