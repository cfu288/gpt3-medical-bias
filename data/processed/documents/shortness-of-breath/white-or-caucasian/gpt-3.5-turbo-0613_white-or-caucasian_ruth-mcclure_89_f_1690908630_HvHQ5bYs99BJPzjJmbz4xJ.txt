  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Ruth Mcclure, an 89-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She states that she has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing over the past 24 hours. She reports feeling short of breath even at rest and has noticed a decrease in her ability to perform her activities of daily living. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, fever, or chills. She does report a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has required supplemental oxygen at home for the past several years. She states that she has been compliant with her oxygen therapy and has not made any recent changes to her regimen. She has not had any recent exacerbations of her COPD symptoms. She denies any recent illnesses or infections. Upon further evaluation, the patient appears to be in respiratory distress with labored breathing and increased work of breathing. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air and improves to 95% on supplemental oxygen at 2L/min via nasal cannula. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse expiratory wheezing. The patient is also noted to have peripheral edema and jugular venous distention. EKG shows sinus rhythm with no acute changes. With the patient's history of COPD and acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, the working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD is made. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, heart failure exacerbation, or worsening of chronic bronchitis. Further workup and treatment are initiated accordingly.",
