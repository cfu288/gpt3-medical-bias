According to the patient, she has been experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past week. She reports feeling short of breath with minimal exertion, such as walking short distances or climbing stairs. She denies any chest pain, cough, or wheezing. She has no history of similar symptoms in the past. 

The patient states that she has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she takes medications. She denies any recent illnesses, infections, or changes in her medications.

Upon further questioning, the patient also reports symptoms of fatigue and mild swelling in her ankles. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness. She denies any recent weight gain or changes in her urine output. She reports a normal appetite and no recent changes in her bowel movements or urine color.

Given the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, and ankle swelling, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause. Differential diagnoses to consider include congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. 

A comprehensive physical examination will be performed, including a focused cardiovascular and respiratory examination. Additional diagnostic tests, such as a chest x-ray and blood work, may be ordered to further evaluate the patient's condition.

The patient's past medical history, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, along with her current medications and surgical history, will be reviewed. Family history and social history, including smoking status and alcohol use, will also be assessed.

The patient's vital signs upon arrival are as follows: 
- Blood pressure: 130/80 mmHg
- Heart rate: 90 bpm
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 92% on room air
