  "patient_name": "Edwina Duncan",
  "age": "67",
  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient arrived to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath that began earlier today. She states that she was sleeping when she was suddenly awakened by a feeling of suffocation. The shortness of breath has been progressively worsening throughout the day. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. She reports no recent travel or sick contacts. Patient has a history of asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She denies any recent exacerbation of her asthma symptoms. On physical examination, the patient appears slightly dyspneic and is able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with scattered wheezing. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Given the patient's history of asthma and acute onset of dyspnea, I suspect an asthma exacerbation as the cause of her symptoms. However, I will order additional tests to rule out any other possible causes.",
