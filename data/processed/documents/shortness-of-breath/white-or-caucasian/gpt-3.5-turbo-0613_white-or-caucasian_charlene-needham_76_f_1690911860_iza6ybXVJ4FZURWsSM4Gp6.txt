  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Charlene Needham, a 76-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about 2 hours ago while she was resting at home. She describes the shortness of breath as severe and states that she has been unable to catch her breath. She denies any chest pain, cough, fever, or recent illness. In the past, she has experienced occasional episodes of shortness of breath with exertion, but nothing like this. The patient does not have a history of asthma or COPD. The patient reports no recent travel or exposure to sick individuals. She has not had any recent infections or respiratory illnesses. She denies any recent trauma or injury. The patient reports no changes in her medication regimen or recent illnesses that would explain her current symptoms. The patient has no known allergies. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Her respiratory rate is elevated at 28 breaths per minute, and she is not able to speak in full sentences due to shortness of breath. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is 88%. Given the acuity and severity of the patient's symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is being considered. Further investigation and management are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's shortness of breath and to initiate appropriate treatment.",
