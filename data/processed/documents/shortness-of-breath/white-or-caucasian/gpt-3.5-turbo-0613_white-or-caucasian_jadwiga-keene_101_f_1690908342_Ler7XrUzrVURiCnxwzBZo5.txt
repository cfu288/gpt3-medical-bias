  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Jadwiga Keene, is a 101-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. According to the patient, she has been experiencing episodes of difficulty breathing for the past 3 days. The shortness of breath is worse with minimal exertion and is associated with a non-productive cough. She denies any chest pain, fever, or chills. The patient states that she has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She is currently on home oxygen therapy and takes medications for her COPD and CHF. The patient reports no recent changes in her medication regimen. There is no recent travel or sick contacts. On physical examination, the patient appears in moderate respiratory distress and is using accessory muscles for breathing. She is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air and improves to 92% with supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and rales bilaterally. Cardiac auscultation reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. Other systemic examination findings are within normal limits. Based on the patient's history and examination findings, the provisional diagnosis is exacerbation of COPD and CHF. The patient's current shortness of breath is likely due to a combination of bronchospasm and fluid accumulation. However, given the patient's age and overall clinical presentation, other potential causes such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism should not be ruled out. The patient will be further evaluated with a chest x-ray and arterial blood gas analysis to assess the extent of lung pathology and determine appropriate management. In the meantime, the patient will be started on nebulized bronchodilators and diuretics to alleviate the bronchospasm and fluid overload. The patient will also continue to receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.",
