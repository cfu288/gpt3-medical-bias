{"patient_name": "April Hale", "age": "35", "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath", "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, April Hale, is a 35-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with chief complaint of shortness of breath. She states that the shortness of breath began suddenly this morning and has been progressively worsening throughout the day. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, cough, or fever. She reports no recent travel or sick contacts. She has no history of asthma or allergies. Upon arrival, she appeared anxious and was using accessory muscles to breathe. On physical examination, her respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and diffuse inspiratory crackles bilaterally. Initial vital signs were within normal limits. Given the acuity and severity of her symptoms, a chest x-ray was obtained which showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Given the clinical presentation and radiographic findings, the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and blood tests including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were ordered. She was also given a nebulized bronchodilator and intravenous fluids. The patient's condition will be closely monitored." , "review_of_symptoms": { "constitutional": "", "cardiovascular": "", "respiratory": "Shortness of breath, no cough or wheezing", "gi": "", "gu": "", "musculoskeletal": "", "skin": "", "neurologic": "" }, "past_medical_history": "", "medications": "", "past_surgical_history": "", "family_history": "", "social_history": "" }
