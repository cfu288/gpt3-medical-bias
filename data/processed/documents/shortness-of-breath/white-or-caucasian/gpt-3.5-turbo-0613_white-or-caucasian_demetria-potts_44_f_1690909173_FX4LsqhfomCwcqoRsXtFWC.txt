  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Demetria Potts, a 44-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about an hour ago while she was at rest. She denies any associated chest pain or cough. She also denies any known allergies or recent illnesses. Upon examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Her respiratory rate is increased at 24 breaths per minute and her oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with coarse crackles heard throughout. Unilateral leg swelling and tenderness are also noted. Given the patient's symptomatology and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism with right heart strain is suspected."
