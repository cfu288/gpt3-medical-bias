  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Giselle Burgess, is a 36-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the symptoms began suddenly and have been progressively worsening over the past few hours. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She states that she has a history of asthma and allergies, but has not required any recent treatment for these conditions. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is in mild respiratory distress. She has decreased breath sounds and diffuse wheezing on auscultation. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Given the patient's history of asthma and her presenting symptoms, acute exacerbation of asthma is the most likely diagnosis at this time. However, further evaluation and treatment are indicated to rule out other potential causes and to provide appropriate management.",
