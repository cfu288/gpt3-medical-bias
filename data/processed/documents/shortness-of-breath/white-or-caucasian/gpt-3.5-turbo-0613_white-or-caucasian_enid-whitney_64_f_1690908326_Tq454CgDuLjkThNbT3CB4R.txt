  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Enid Whitney, is a 64-year-old female presenting to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. According to the patient, the shortness of breath started approximately 2 hours ago and is associated with mild chest discomfort. There were no precipitating factors identified. The patient denies any fever or cough. She states that she has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and asthma. Initial vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side and mild wheezing. A chest X-ray was obtained and showed a left-sided pneumothorax. Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the likely cause of her shortness of breath is a spontaneous pneumothorax. The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and a chest tube was inserted to evacuate the air and re-expand the lung. The patient's symptoms improved and she was admitted to the hospital for further observation and management."
