She reports that the shortness of breath began earlier today and has been progressively worsening since then. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She reports no known exposure to COVID-19. She denies any recent travel or sick contacts. She has a history of asthma but denies any recent exacerbations. She has been using her rescue inhaler as needed and reports it providing some relief but not completely resolving her symptoms. On physical examination, she appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds and scattered wheezes bilaterally. She has decreased air movement on inspiration and expiration. Vital signs are stable. Oxygen saturation on room air is 90%. Given the history and examination findings, a diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation is suspected. ",
