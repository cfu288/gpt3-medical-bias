  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Davina Miller, a 34-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She states that the symptoms started suddenly about an hour ago while she was resting at home. She describes the shortness of breath as severe, with difficulty taking a deep breath and a feeling of tightness in her chest. She denies any associated symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, fever, or cough. She has no significant medical history and does not take any medications regularly. She has no known allergies. She reports no recent illnesses or travel. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in mild distress, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Heart sounds are normal, and lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with scattered wheezes. No other abnormalities are noted on examination. Given the patient's acute onset of shortness of breath and physical examination findings consistent with acute bronchospasm, a diagnosis of asthma exacerbation is suspected. Further evaluation and management will include obtaining a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. The patient will also receive nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids to relieve her symptoms.",
