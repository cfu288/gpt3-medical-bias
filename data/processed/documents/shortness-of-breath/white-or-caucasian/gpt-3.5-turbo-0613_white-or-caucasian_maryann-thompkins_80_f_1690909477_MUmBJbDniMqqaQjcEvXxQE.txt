The symptoms began earlier today and she describes them as sudden in onset and progressively worsening. The patient reports feeling increasingly breathless with minimal exertion. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, fever, or chills. She also denies any recent travel or exposure to sick individuals. It is important to note that the patient has a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. She is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history. Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds and diffuse expiratory wheezes.
