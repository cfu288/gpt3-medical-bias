  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Emery Patterson, is an 18-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that she has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing over the past 24 hours. She also complains of a cough and mild chest pain. The patient denies any fever or chills. She reports no recent travel or sick contacts. She denies any known allergies. Upon initial evaluation, the patient appears to be in mild distress, using accessory muscles to breathe. Her oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. A preliminary examination reveals diminished breath sounds and scattered crackles on auscultation of the lung fields. The rest of the physical examination is within normal limits. 

The patient reports no significant past medical history. She takes no medications on a regular basis and denies any recent surgeries. Her family history and social history are unremarkable at this time. 

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, bronchitis, and asthma exacerbation. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. A chest X-ray, complete blood count, and arterial blood gas analysis will be ordered. The patient will be started on supplemental oxygen, as needed, and a bronchodilator treatment to alleviate her symptoms. The patient's condition will be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions will be initiated based on the test results. She will also be advised to follow up with her primary care physician for further management. Education on smoking cessation and respiratory hygiene will be provided.
