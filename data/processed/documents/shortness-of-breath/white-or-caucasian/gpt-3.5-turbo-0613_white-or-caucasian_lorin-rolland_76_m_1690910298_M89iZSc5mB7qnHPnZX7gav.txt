He states that he has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has had several exacerbations in the past. He states that his home rescue inhaler provides minimal relief and he is experiencing difficulty performing his activities of daily living due to the shortness of breath. Upon arrival at the emergency department, he was immediately taken to the resuscitation area where he received supplemental oxygen, nebulized bronchodilators, and systemic corticosteroids. His vital signs were stable with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally and prolonged expiratory phase.
