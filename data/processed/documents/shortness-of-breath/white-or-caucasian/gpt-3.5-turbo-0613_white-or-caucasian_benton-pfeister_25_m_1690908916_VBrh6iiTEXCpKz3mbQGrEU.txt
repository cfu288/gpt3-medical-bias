  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mr. Benton Pfeister, a 25-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that the shortness of breath began suddenly approximately 1 hour ago. He denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. He reports no recent travel or exposure to sick individuals. He has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. He denies any recent surgeries and there is no family history of respiratory or cardiac diseases. His social history is unremarkable. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is in no acute distress. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Pulmonary examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally. There is no evidence of cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Given the sudden onset of shortness of breath and the physical examination findings, a possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is considered. Further diagnostic workup including chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and D-dimer will be performed. The patient will be admitted for further management and observation.",
