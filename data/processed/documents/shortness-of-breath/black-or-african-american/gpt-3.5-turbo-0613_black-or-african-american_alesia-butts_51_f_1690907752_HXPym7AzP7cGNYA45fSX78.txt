  "patient_name": "Alesia Butts",

  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the symptoms started suddenly about an hour ago and have been progressively worsening. She denies any associated chest pain or cough. She reports no recent sick contacts or exposure to known irritants. She has a past medical history of asthma and is prescribed albuterol inhaler as needed. 

On further questioning, the patient denies any fever, chills, or a recent change in weight. She also denies any palpitations or lightheadedness. 

Physical examination reveals tachypnea with an increased respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing. Oxygen saturation on room air is 90%. 

Given the patient's history of asthma and symptoms of shortness of breath with wheezing, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is likely. However, a thorough evaluation and workup is warranted to rule out other potential causes.

The patient should be placed on supplemental oxygen, started on nebulized albuterol treatments, and have a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and chest X-ray ordered. Asthma action plan should be reviewed with the patient and she should have a follow-up with her primary care physician for further management.",
