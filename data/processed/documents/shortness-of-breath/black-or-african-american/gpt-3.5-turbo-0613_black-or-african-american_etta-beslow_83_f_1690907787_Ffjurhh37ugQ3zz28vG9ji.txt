The patient reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly earlier this evening while she was at home. She describes the shortness of breath as severe and associated with mild chest pain. The patient denies any fever, cough, or wheezing. She also denies any recent illness or travel. She has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. On examination, the patient appears in moderate distress, with increased work of breathing. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and crackles in the bilateral lung bases. Vital signs are within normal limits. Given her symptoms and examination findings, the patient's shortness of breath is concerning for a possible exacerbation of her underlying cardiac or pulmonary condition. Further evaluation and management are warranted.",
