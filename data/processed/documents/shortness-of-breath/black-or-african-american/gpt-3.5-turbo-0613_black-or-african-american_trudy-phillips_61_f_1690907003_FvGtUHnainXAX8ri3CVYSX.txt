She reports that her symptoms began this morning and have been progressively worsening. She describes the shortness of breath as a feeling of not being able to catch her breath, especially with minimal exertion. She denies any chest pain or cough. The patient states that she does have a history of smoking, with a 30-pack year history. Upon examination, the patient is visibly in respiratory distress, with increased respiratory effort and use of accessory muscles. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and scattered wheezes throughout both lung fields. Heart sounds are normal on auscultation. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is suspected.
