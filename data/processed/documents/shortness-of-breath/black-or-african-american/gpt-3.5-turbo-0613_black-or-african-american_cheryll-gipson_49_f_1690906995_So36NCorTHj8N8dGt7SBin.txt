  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Cheryll Gipson is a 49-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient reports that the shortness of breath has been progressively worsening over the past few days and is associated with cough and mild chest discomfort. She denies any fevers, chills, or recent illness. The patient has a medical history of asthma and seasonal allergies, but reports that her symptoms are different from her usual asthma exacerbations. On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented, breathing comfortably but with increased work of breathing. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and scattered wheezes throughout all lung fields. No signs of respiratory distress. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Given the patient's symptoms and exam findings, the possibility of acute exacerbation of asthma is high, but other differential diagnosis such as pneumonia and pulmonary embolism should also be considered.",
