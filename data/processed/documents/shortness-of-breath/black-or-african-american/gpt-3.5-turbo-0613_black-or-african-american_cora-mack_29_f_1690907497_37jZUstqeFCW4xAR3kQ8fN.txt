She reports that she has been experiencing this symptom for the past 2 days, and it has been progressively worsening. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She also reports a history of asthma and occasional use of her inhaler for symptom relief. On physical examination, the patient appears mildly anxious with increased respiratory effort. Lung auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds with diffuse expiratory wheezes. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Given the severity of her symptoms and the potential for worsening, a decision was made to admit the patient for further evaluation and management.",
