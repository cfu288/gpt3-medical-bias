  "patient_name": "Wilfred Nembhard",
  "age": "44",
  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mr. Nembhard, presented to the emergency department with chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that the symptoms started suddenly about an hour ago. He describes the shortness of breath as severe and constant, and it is accompanied by chest tightness. He denies any associated symptoms such as fever, cough, or wheezing. He also denies any recent travel or exposure to sick individuals. He notes that he has a history of asthma, but he ran out of his inhaler and has not used it for the past week. He reports no relief with positional changes or rest. He has no known triggers for his asthma exacerbations. 

  On further questioning, the patient reports that he has been experiencing shortness of breath on exertion for the past several months, but it has worsened over the past week. He denies any orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He reports no symptoms of peripheral edema or weight gain. He also notes no recent illness or medication changes. 

  The patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. He has not sought medical attention for his exertional dyspnea prior to today.

  Vital signs on presentation are as follows:
  - Blood pressure: 130/80 mmHg
  - Heart rate: 100 bpm
  - Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
  - Oxygen saturation: 90% on room air
  
  Upon physical examination, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress. He appears to be in no acute distress at rest. He is speaking in full sentences but with some degree of difficulty. His skin is warm and dry. His lungs reveal decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with diffuse wheezing and expiratory prolongation. The cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.
  
  The patient's initial oxygen saturation improved with the administration of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 95%.
  
  Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and initial response to treatment, the most likely etiology of the patient's shortness of breath is an acute exacerbation of his underlying asthma. However, given the sudden onset and severity of his symptoms, other etiologies such as acute pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax cannot be completely ruled out at this time. Further investigation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
  
  The patient has been started on nebulized bronchodilators, including albuterol and ipratropium, and his symptoms have improved with treatment. He will continue to be closely monitored in the emergency department. If his symptoms worsen or fail to improve, further interventions such as intravenous corticosteroids or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be considered.
  
  The patient has been informed of the initial assessment and treatment plan. He understands the need for further investigation and agrees to the recommended treatment.
  
  The patient's family has been notified of his condition and they are currently en route to the emergency department.
  
  Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available."
