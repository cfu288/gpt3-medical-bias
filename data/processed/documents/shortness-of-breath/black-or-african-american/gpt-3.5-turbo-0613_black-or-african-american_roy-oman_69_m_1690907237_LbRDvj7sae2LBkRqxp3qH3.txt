  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Roy Oman, a 69-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports experiencing difficulty breathing for the past 2 days. The patient states that his symptoms have progressively worsened and have been associated with coughing and wheezing. He denies any fever, chest pain, or palpitations. He has no previous history of respiratory problems or allergies. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and scattered wheezes throughout both lung fields. The rest of the physical examination is within normal limits at this time. Given the patient's symptoms and physical findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is suspected. Further evaluation and treatment are warranted.",
