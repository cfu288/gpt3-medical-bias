  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Leighton Wiley, is a 23-year-old female presenting to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago and have worsened progressively. The patient reports feeling short of breath even at rest, and states that she has been experiencing increased fatigue and occasional episodes of coughing. She denies any chest pain or wheezing. She has no significant medical history and is not currently taking any medications. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Her respiratory rate is increased and she is tachycardic. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Given the sudden onset and severity of her symptoms, a thorough evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause of her shortness of breath."
