Symptoms started abruptly earlier today while at rest and have been getting progressively worse. The patient reports associated chest tightness and wheezing. He denies any fever, cough, or sputum production. He has no significant medical history and denies any recent illness or exposure to sick contacts. Upon further evaluation, the patient appears in moderate respiratory distress, with increased work of breathing. Oxygen saturation on room air is 90%. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds and diffuse bilateral wheezing. The patient is able to speak in full sentences but is visibly anxious and unable to lie flat due to dyspnea. 
Further assessment and management are warranted to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.",
