  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Eva Blakes, a 64-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The symptom started abruptly about 2 hours ago while she was resting at home. She reports that the shortness of breath is associated with mild chest discomfort and feels worse with exertion. She denies any cough, fever, or recent illness. She has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Upon arrival, the patient was visibly distressed and breathing rapidly. Physical examination reveals tachypnea and decreased breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Given her symptoms and examination findings, the working diagnosis at this time is acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, other causes of acute shortness of breath, such as pulmonary embolism and cardiac ischemia, need to be ruled out. The patient will undergo further diagnostic tests and treatment as appropriate. ",
