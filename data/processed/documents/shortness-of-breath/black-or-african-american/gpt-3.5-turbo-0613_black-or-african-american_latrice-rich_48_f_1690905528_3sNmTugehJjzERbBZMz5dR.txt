  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Latrice Rich, a 48-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She states that she has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing for the past 24 hours. The shortness of breath is constant and worsens with minimal exertion. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. She reports a history of asthma but states that her symptoms are different from her typical asthma exacerbations. She has been using her rescue inhaler without relief. It is important to note that she has a known history of congestive heart failure and has been noncompliant with her medications recently. She also mentions a recent upper respiratory tract infection. No recent travel or sick contacts. Denied substance abuse or new medication use.

  During the physical examination, the patient appears to be in mild distress with increased work of breathing. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6Â°F, heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals fine crackles bilaterally, more prominent in the bases. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs or gallops. There is trace bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

  Based on the patient's presentation and examination findings, the differential diagnosis includes exacerbation of congestive heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and exacerbation of asthma.

  Further workup is warranted, including a chest X-ray, arterial blood gas analysis, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained to evaluate for any cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias. Given the patient's symptoms and history, she will likely require hospital admission for further management and monitoring.

  The patient has been informed of the initial findings and the plan for further workup and admission. She has consented to the necessary tests and procedures and understands the potential risks and benefits. We will continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and administer supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

  Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns.
