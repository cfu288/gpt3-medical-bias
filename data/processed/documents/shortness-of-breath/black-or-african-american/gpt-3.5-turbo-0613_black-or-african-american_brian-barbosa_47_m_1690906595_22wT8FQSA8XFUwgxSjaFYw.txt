  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Brian Barbosa, a 47-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that the shortness of breath started two hours ago and has been gradually worsening. He denies any associated chest pain, cough, fever, or other respiratory symptoms. He does, however, report a history of smoking for 20 years, with a 1 pack per day smoking habit. He also notes a significant family history of heart disease, with his father and two siblings having had heart attacks at an early age. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. His respiratory rate is elevated at 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals coarse crackles bilaterally. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently receiving supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygen saturation above 92%. Bloodwork, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, has been sent for analysis. The patient has been started on nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids for bronchodilation and inflammation control, respectively. He will be admitted to the hospital for further management and close monitoring of his respiratory status.",
