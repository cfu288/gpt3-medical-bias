  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Bridgette Harris, a 50-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The symptoms started suddenly approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. She reports feeling increasingly short of breath when lying down, and the dyspnea is worsened with minimal exertion. There is no associated chest pain, cough, or fever. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or exposure to animals. She has a history of asthma, which is typically well-controlled with albuterol inhaler. However, she states that her inhaler has not provided relief during this episode. Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with fine inspiratory crackles throughout. Due to her acute onset of dyspnea and physical examination findings, acute exacerbation of asthma or congestive heart failure are suspected. Further evaluation and treatment will be initiated."
