  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Trenton Wilson, a 25-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that he has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing over the past day. He describes the shortness of breath as sudden in onset and progressively worsening. He denies any associated chest pain, cough, fever, or chills. He also denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or exposure to allergens or pollutants. The patient states that he has no significant past medical history and takes no medications on a regular basis. Physical examination of the patient reveals tachypnea and increased work of breathing with use of accessory muscles. His lung examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes. Oxygen saturation on room air is 92%. The patient appears uncomfortable but is able to speak in full sentences without significant effort. Given the severity of his symptoms and the physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation is suspected, with consideration for other possible causes of acute dyspnea. A management plan will be instituted to address the patient's symptoms and to determine the underlying etiology of his shortness of breath.",
