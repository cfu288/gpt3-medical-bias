  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Coleman Sumter, a 20-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The shortness of breath began approximately 2 hours ago and has progressively worsened. He reports associated symptoms of chest tightness and wheezing. He denies any recent illness or exposure to sick contacts. He has no significant past medical history. Upon arrival, the patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 30 breaths per minute and he appears to be in moderate respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. He is able to speak in full sentences but with some difficulty due to shortness of breath. Diffuse bilateral wheezing is heard upon auscultation of the lungs. Based on these findings, the working diagnosis is acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. The patient requires immediate medical intervention to relieve his symptoms and optimize his breathing. Oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula has been initiated at 2 liters per minute to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%. A short-acting beta-agonist nebulizer treatment with albuterol has been administered to provide bronchodilation. Additionally, the patient has been started on systemic corticosteroids for their anti-inflammatory effects. Chest x-ray and blood tests, including complete blood count and arterial blood gas analysis, have been ordered to further evaluate the patient. The patient is closely monitored during his hospital stay and will be re-assessed regularly to assess his response to treatment.",
