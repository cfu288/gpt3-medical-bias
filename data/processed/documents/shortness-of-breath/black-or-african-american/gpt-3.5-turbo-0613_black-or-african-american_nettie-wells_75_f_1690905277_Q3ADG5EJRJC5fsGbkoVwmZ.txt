  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Nettie Wells, a 75-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient states that she has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing over the past 24 hours. She reports feeling short of breath at rest and with minimal exertion. She denies any chest pain, cough, or leg swelling. The patient also reports feeling fatigued and weak. She has no known history of similar symptoms. On physical examination, the patient appears in distress and is using accessory muscles of respiration. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezing. The patient's oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Given the acute onset and worsening symptoms, the differential diagnosis includes acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and congestive heart failure. The patient's age, shortness of breath, and wheezing on lung auscultation are concerning for COPD exacerbation. Further evaluation and management are warranted.",
