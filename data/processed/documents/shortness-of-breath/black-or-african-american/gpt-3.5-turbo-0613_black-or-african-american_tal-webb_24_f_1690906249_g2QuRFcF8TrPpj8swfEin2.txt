She reports that the shortness of breath started a few hours ago and has been progressively worsening. She denies any chest pain or coughing. On examination, the patient appears anxious and is working hard to breathe. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with crackles heard throughout. The patient also has tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Initial oxygen saturation was 92%, which improved to 96% with supplemental oxygen. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the primary concern is acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia. Further investigations and management will be initiated to determine the underlying cause.",
