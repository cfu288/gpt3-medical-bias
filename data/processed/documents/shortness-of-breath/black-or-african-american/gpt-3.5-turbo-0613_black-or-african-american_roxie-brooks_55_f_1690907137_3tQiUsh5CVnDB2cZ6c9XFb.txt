  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Roxie Brooks, a 55-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that she has been experiencing shortness of breath for the past 2 days. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She reports that the shortness of breath is worse with exertion and improves with rest. There is no significant past medical history or recent travel. She denies any known exposures to infectious diseases. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in mild respiratory distress. She is speaking in complete sentences and is able to maintain an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The rest of her vital signs are within normal limits. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds over the bases with no wheezing or crackles. There are no other abnormal findings on physical examination. Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely etiology for her shortness of breath is a lower respiratory tract infection such as pneumonia. Further evaluation and treatment are warranted.",
