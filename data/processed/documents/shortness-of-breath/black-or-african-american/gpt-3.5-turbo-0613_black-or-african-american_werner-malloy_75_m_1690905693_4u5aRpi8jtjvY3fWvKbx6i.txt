He notes that he has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. He denies any recent illnesses or exposure to sick contacts. On physical examination, he appears anxious and short of breath, with increased work of breathing and decreased breath sounds on the right side of his chest. Vital signs are as follows: heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air.
