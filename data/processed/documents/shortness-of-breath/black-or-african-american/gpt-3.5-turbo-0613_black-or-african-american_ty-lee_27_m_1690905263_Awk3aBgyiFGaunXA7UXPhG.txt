  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient Ty Lee, a 27-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that the shortness of breath started approximately 2 hours ago while he was resting at home. He describes it as a sudden onset and progressively worsening. He denies any associated chest pain, palpitations, or cough. He states that he has no prior episodes of similar symptoms. His medical history is unremarkable and he takes no regular medications. On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and is using accessory muscles to breathe. He is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation on room air is 88%. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Given the acuity of his symptoms and the low oxygen saturation, he was immediately placed on oxygen therapy via a non-rebreather mask. Initial treatment with nebulized bronchodilators was initiated in the emergency department along with systemic corticosteroids.",
