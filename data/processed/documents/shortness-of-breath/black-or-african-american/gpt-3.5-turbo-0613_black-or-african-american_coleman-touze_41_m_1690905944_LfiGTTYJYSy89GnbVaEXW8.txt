  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Coleman Touze, a 41-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about 30 minutes ago and has been gradually worsening. He denies any other associated symptoms, such as chest pain, cough, or fever. He has no known history of respiratory or cardiac conditions. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is breathing rapidly with increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally and fine crackles at the bases. The patient's oxygen saturation is 89% on room air. Given the patient's symptoms and physical findings, a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is suspected. Immediate interventions include supplemental oxygen therapy, close monitoring of vital signs, and initiation of a non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.",
