He reports that the symptom has been gradually worsening over the past week and is now causing significant discomfort. He denies any associated chest pain, cough, fever, or other respiratory symptoms. He states that he has been using his albuterol inhaler without relief. On examination, the patient appears anxious and is tachypneic with increased work of breathing. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing.
