  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the symptoms started earlier today and have been gradually worsening. She denies any fever, cough, or chest pain. She states that she has a history of asthma but her symptoms do not feel like her usual asthma attacks. She states that she uses her inhaler as needed and has not needed it today. On exam, the patient appears dyspneic and is using accessory muscles of breathing. She has decreased breath sounds on auscultation. Given her history of asthma and the acute onset of dyspnea, the concern for an acute exacerbation of asthma is high. However, other causes of dyspnea such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism should also be considered. Further assessment and investigations are needed.",
