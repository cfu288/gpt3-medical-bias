  "chief_complaint": "Shortness of Breath",
  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Bettie Reedy, a 79-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient reports that she has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing over the past 48 hours. She describes the shortness of breath as occurring at rest and worsening with exertion. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, fever, or leg swelling. 

  The patient states that she has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently taking medications for her hypertension and diabetes, but she is unsure of the names and doses. She has a history of smoking, with a 40 pack-year smoking history, but she quit smoking 10 years ago. 

  The patient denies any recent surgeries or hospitalizations. She does not have a  family history of lung disease or cardiovascular disease. She lives alone in a single-story house and is independent with her activities of daily living. She denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use. 

  On physical examination, the patient appears ill but in no acute distress. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air. She has bilateral decreased breath sounds and is using accessory muscles of respiration. There is no jugular venous distention or peripheral edema noted. 

  Given the patient's history of COPD and the acute onset of shortness of breath, a primary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD is suspected. However, due to her decreased oxygen saturation, consideration is also given to the possibility of pulmonary embolism or pneumonia. Additional workup including a chest X-ray, arterial blood gas analysis, and D-dimer test are ordered. The patient is placed on supplemental oxygen to improve her oxygen saturation. In the meantime, she is given nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids to manage her respiratory symptoms. 

  The patient's daughter is at the bedside and is updated on the plan of care. She is advised to stay with the patient and to notify the nursing staff if the patient's condition worsens. The patient is transported to the radiology department for the chest X-ray and blood work. She will be admitted to the medical ward for further management and monitoring.",
