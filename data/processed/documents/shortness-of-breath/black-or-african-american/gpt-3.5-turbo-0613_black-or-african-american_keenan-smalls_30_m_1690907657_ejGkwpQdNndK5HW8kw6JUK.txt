  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Keenan Smalls, a 30-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient reports that he has been experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past two days. He describes the shortness of breath as being worse with exertion and associated with a non-productive cough. He denies any associated chest pain, fever, or chills. The patient states that he has no significant medical history and does not take any medications. He denies any recent sick contacts or travel. On physical examination, the patient appears mildly anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. He is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. There are no signs of respiratory distress or cyanosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and temperature of 98.6Â°F. Initial assessment of the patient suggests the possibility of an acute respiratory infection or an exacerbation of an underlying respiratory condition. Further evaluation and testing, including chest X-ray and laboratory investigations, will be pursued to determine the exact cause of the patient's symptoms.",
