He reports no associated chest pain, cough, or fever. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. He has decreased breath sounds and decreased oxygen saturation on room air. Rapid bedside spirometry reveals decreased lung function with decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).
