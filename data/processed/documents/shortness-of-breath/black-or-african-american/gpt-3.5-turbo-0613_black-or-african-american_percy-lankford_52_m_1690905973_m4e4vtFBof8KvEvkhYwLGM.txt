He denies any chest pain, cough, wheezing, or fever associated with the shortness of breath. The patient reports no recent travel, sick contacts, or known exposure to COVID-19.

On physical examination, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress. He is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation on room air is 88%. Auscultation of the lungs reveals widespread bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds at the bases. The patient is placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. An arterial blood gas is obtained and shows a pH of 7.45, pCO2 of 35 mmHg, and pO2 of 60 mmHg. A chest X-ray is ordered to evaluate for any underlying pathology.",
