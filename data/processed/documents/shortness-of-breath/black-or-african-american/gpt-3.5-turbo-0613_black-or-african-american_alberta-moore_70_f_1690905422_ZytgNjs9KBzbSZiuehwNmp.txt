  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Alberta Moore, is a 70-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that her symptoms started suddenly this morning and have been progressively worsening since then. She denies any chest pain or palpitations. She also denies any recent travel or sick contacts. She has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which are well-controlled with medications. She denies any history of respiratory conditions or allergies. On physical examination, the patient appears to be in mild respiratory distress. She is tachycardic with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute and her oxygen saturation on room air is 90%. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral inspiratory and expiratory wheezing. Given her symptoms and physical findings, an initial diagnosis of acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma is suspected. Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the appropriate management plan.",
