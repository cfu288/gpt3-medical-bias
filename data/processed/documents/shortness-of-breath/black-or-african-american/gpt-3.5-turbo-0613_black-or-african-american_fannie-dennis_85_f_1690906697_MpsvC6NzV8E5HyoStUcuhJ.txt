  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Fannie Dennis, an 85-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about an hour ago and has been progressively worsening. She denies any associated chest pain or fever. The patient has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. She is a current smoker with a 30-pack-year smoking history. On examination, the patient appears to be in mild respiratory distress. She is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds and diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Given the acute onset and worsening of her symptoms, a diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD is suspected. The patient has been started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Continuous nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide have also been initiated to relieve her symptoms and improve bronchodilation. The patient will be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress or worsening oxygenation. Bloodwork including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and arterial blood gas will be obtained to further evaluate the patient's condition. Additionally, a chest X-ray will be performed to rule out any alternative causes of her shortness of breath.",
