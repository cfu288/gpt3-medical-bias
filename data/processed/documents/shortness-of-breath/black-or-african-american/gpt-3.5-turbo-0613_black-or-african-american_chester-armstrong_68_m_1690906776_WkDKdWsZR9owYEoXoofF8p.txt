He states that he has been experiencing difficulty breathing and feels like he can't catch his breath. He denies any chest pain or cough. He states that he has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. He also reports that he is a former smoker, but quit 5 years ago. He denies any other associated symptoms. On physical examination, Mr. Armstrong was found to have tachypnea and labored breathing. His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds and occasional wheezing. He was given a bronchodilator nebulizer treatment, which provided some relief of his symptoms. Further evaluation and workup, including a chest x-ray and blood tests, were ordered to determine the underlying cause of his shortness of breath.",
