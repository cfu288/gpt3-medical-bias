  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Stanford Coley, a 27-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient reports sudden onset of difficulty breathing which has been progressively worsening over the past few hours. He denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. He has no history of similar symptoms in the past. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or exposure to any known allergens. 

The patient is speaking in full sentences and appears to be in moderate distress. He is using accessory muscles to breathe and his respiratory rate is increased. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally without any added sounds. No edema is noted in the lower extremities. 

Given the patient's acute onset of shortness of breath without any known triggers, evaluation for a potential pulmonary embolism or acute exacerbation of asthma is warranted. Further diagnostic workup including chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and arterial blood gases will be pursued.",
