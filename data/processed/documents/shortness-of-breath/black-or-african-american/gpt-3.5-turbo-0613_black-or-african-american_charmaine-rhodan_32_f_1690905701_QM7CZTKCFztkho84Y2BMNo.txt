She reports that the shortness of breath started suddenly about 3 hours ago. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, or fever. She does note some mild wheezing and an increased respiratory rate.

Initial vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination reveals bilateral wheezing and some accessory muscle use.
