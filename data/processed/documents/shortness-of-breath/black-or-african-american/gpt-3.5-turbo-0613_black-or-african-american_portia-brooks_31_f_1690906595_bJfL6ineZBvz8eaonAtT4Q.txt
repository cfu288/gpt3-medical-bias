According to the patient, she started experiencing difficulty breathing approximately 2 hours ago. She describes the shortness of breath as sudden in onset, worsened with exertion, and associated with mild chest discomfort. She denies any cough, fever, chills, or other respiratory symptoms. The patient reports no significant medical history and is not taking any medications. There is no history of recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. Upon arrival, the patient's vital signs were stable, with oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. A focused physical examination was performed, which revealed decreased breath sounds on auscultation of the right lower lung field. Considering the patient's symptoms and examination findings, a preliminary diagnosis of pneumonia is being considered. Further investigations, including a chest x-ray and laboratory tests, will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment. The patient has been provided supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%."
