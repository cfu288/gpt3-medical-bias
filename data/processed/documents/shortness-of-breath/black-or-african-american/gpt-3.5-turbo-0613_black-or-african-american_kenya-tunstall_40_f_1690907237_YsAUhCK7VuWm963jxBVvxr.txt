According to the patient, she has been experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past few days. She reports that she has been unable to perform her usual activities and has noticed increased difficulty breathing even at rest. She denies any associated chest pain, cough, fever, or other respiratory symptoms. She states that she has no history of similar symptoms in the past. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and is using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally and scattered wheezes. The patient's oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is suspected, but other causes of respiratory distress such as pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax should also be considered.",
