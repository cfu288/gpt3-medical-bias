  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Ola Armstead, is a 64-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She reports that her symptoms started gradually two days ago and have been worsening. She describes the shortness of breath as a tightness in her chest and difficulty breathing. She denies any associated cough or wheezing. She has no known allergies or recent travel history. 

Upon further questioning, the patient reports experiencing fatigue and mild chest discomfort. She denies any other symptoms such as fever, chills, or changes in appetite. She states that she has been experiencing some swelling in her ankles and feet for the past month, but did not seek medical attention until now.

The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. She takes medications including amlodipine and atorvastatin for her hypertension and hyperlipidemia, respectively. She has no known allergies to any medications. 

In terms of social history, the patient is a retired school teacher and lives alone. She is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or substance abuse. 

Given her symptoms and past medical history, further evaluation is warranted to determine the cause of her shortness of breath. Chest X-ray, EKG, and laboratory tests will be ordered to assess cardiac and pulmonary function. The patient will be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress and treated accordingly.

A consultation with a cardiologist and pulmonologist will be requested to assist with the management of the patient's condition. The patient will also be educated on heart-healthy lifestyle modifications including a low-sodium diet and regular exercise.

Family history and past surgical history are pending as the patient did not provide information during the initial assessment.

A nurse will be assigned to closely monitor the patient's vital signs and oxygen saturation levels. Respiratory treatments including supplemental oxygen and bronchodilators may be initiated as needed.

The patient's condition will be tracked and further updates will be provided as necessary."
