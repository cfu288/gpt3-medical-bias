The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a crushing sensation in the center of the chest.

Upon arrival, an EKG was performed and showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Given the clinical presentation and EKG findings, a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI) was suspected and the patient was immediately started on aspirin, oxygen, and nitroglycerin. The patient was also given morphine for pain relief. Cardiology consultation was obtained and the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent coronary angiography. The patient was found to have a complete occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. The procedure was successful and there were no immediate complications. The patient was then transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for further management and monitoring.",
