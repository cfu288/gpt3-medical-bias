  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Joi Waguespack, a 57-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She reports that the pain started approximately 2 hours ago while she was resting at home. The pain is described as a squeezing sensation in the center of her chest and radiating to her left arm. She rates the pain as 8/10 in intensity and states that it has not improved with rest. She denies any associated shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. 

On arrival, the patient appeared in moderate distress due to the pain. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Cardiac monitoring showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST segment changes or arrhythmias. On physical examination, the patient's chest was non-tender to palpation with no signs of trauma or deformities. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs or rubs. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally. Abdominal examination was unremarkable.

Given the patient's symptoms of chest pain, further evaluation and management are warranted. Initial diagnostic tests ordered include an ECG, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and cardiac biomarkers. The patient has been placed on oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min and started on an IV line for medication administration. Pain relief is being provided with sublingual nitroglycerin.

The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in her symptoms or new onset of complications. Further investigations and interventions will depend on the results of the initial diagnostic workup and clinical assessment.
