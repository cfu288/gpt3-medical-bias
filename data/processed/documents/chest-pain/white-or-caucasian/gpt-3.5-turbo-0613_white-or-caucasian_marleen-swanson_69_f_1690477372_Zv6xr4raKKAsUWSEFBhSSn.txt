  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Marleen Swanson, a 69-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. She describes the pain as a dull ache in the center of her chest that radiates to her left arm. She states that the pain started approximately 2 hours ago and has been persistent since then. She denies any associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea/vomiting. Given the patient's symptoms and concern for cardiac etiology, an EKG was obtained, which showed signs of ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4, consistent with acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzyme markers were sent and troponin levels were found to be elevated. The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and clopidogrel. Emergent cardiac catheterization was performed, which revealed a 90% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. A stent was successfully placed, and the patient is now stable and awaiting further observation.",
