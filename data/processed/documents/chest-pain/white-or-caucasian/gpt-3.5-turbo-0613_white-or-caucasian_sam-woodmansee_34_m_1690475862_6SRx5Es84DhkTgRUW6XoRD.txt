  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Sam Woodmansee, a 34-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. He reports that the pain started approximately 1 hour ago and is located in the center of his chest. The pain is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation and is exacerbated by deep breathing. He denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, or diaphoresis. He has no known history of cardiac disease. He states that he has not had any recent illness or new medications. On further questioning, he reports that the pain started after lifting heavy weights at the gym. Given the patient's concerning symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to rule out cardiac-related causes of chest pain.",
