Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and in moderate distress due to the pain. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. A preliminary examination revealed normal heart sounds and no signs of respiratory distress. Troponin levels were within normal limits.
