The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation in the center of the chest. The patient states that the pain is constant and worsens with deep breathing.

  The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. He denies any history of similar episodes in the past. There is no known trigger for the onset of the pain.

  Upon further questioning, the patient reports no significant medical history, including no known cardiac disease or risk factors for ischemic heart disease. He denies any current use of medications and has never had any surgeries in the past.

  The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

  The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with clear lung sounds bilaterally and no signs of distress.

  The patient will be closely monitored, and further diagnostic studies may be ordered based on the initial findings. A consultation with a cardiologist may also be considered if deemed necessary."
