She states that the pain started suddenly about an hour ago and is located in the center of her chest. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation that worsens with deep breaths and movement. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating. She states that she has never experienced similar symptoms in the past. On physical examination, her vital signs are stable and she appears to be in distress due to the pain. The initial assessment suggests a musculoskeletal etiology for the chest pain. However, other causes such as cardiac, gastrointestinal, or respiratory should also be considered. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests are warranted to determine the underlying cause of the chest pain.",
