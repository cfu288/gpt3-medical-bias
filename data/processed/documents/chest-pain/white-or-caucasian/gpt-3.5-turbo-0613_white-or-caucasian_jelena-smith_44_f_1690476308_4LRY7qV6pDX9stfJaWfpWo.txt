She describes the pain as a squeezing sensation in the center of her chest that came on suddenly while she was at rest. The pain has been persistent for the past 30 minutes and has not improved with rest. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. The patient does not have a history of similar episodes in the past. On further inquiry, she reports a family history of heart disease, with her father having a heart attack at the age of 50. Given her symptoms and family history, we suspect ischemic heart disease and will further investigate.",
