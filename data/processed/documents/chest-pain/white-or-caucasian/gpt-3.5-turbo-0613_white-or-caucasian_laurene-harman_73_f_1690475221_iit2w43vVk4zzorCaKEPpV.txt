  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Laurene Harman, a 73-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. She describes the pain as a squeezing sensation in the middle of her chest that started about 2 hours ago. The pain is radiating down her left arm and she also feels shortness of breath. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea or diaphoresis. The pain has not resolved since onset and has not been relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and takes medications for both conditions. She has no known drug allergies. On examination, the patient appears to be in moderate distress, clutching her chest and exhibiting signs of respiratory distress. Blood pressure is elevated at 160/90 mmHg, heart rate is 100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds and no murmurs. Lung examination is significant for crackles in the bilateral lung bases. The patient is able to move all her extremities without difficulty. The skin is pale and cool to the touch. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, acute coronary syndrome is the leading diagnosis. She will undergo further evaluation, including an EKG and cardiac enzymes.",
