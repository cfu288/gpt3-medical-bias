She rates the pain as 8/10 in severity and states that it radiates to her left arm. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or diaphoresis. Onset of the pain was sudden, and it has been constant since then. The patient reports that she has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it.
