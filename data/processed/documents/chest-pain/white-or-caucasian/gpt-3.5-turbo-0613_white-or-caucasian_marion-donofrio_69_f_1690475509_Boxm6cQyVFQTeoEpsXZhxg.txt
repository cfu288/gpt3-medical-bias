  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Marion Donofrio, a 69-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of the chest lasting for approximately 30 minutes. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She states that the pain started suddenly while she was resting at home and has been constant since then. She has no history of similar episodes in the past. She has taken over-the-counter antacids but has not experienced any relief. On physical examination, the patient appears in mild distress and is diaphoretic. Vital signs are stable. Cardiac auscultation reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Initial EKG shows no acute ST-T changes. Given the patient's presentation with new-onset chest pain, further evaluation and workup are warranted to rule out acute coronary syndrome or other causes of chest pain.",
