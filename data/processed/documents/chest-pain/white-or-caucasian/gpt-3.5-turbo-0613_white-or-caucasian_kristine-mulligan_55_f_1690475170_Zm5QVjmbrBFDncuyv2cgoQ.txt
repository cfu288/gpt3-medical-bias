The patient reports that the chest pain began suddenly about 1 hour ago while she was at rest. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of her chest. The pain radiates to her left arm and jaw. She rates the severity of the pain as 8 out of 10. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She has no prior history of similar symptoms. As per protocol, an EKG was performed upon arrival and showed ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and ST segment depression in leads V2-V4. Considering the patient's history, symptoms, and EKG findings, a diagnosis of probable acute myocardial infarction is suspected. The patient was initiated on aspirin, oxygen, and nitroglycerin.
