  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Theron Martin, a 40-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaint of chest pain. The chest pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation in the left side of the chest. The pain radiates to the left arm and is associated with shortness of breath. The patient denies any other symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or diaphoresis. He has no history of similar episodes in the past. No known precipitating factors.

  On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable due to the chest pain. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds without any murmurs or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No peripheral edema or cyanosis is noted.

  Given the patient's presenting symptoms and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including age and gender, a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is being considered. The patient will be further evaluated with an electrocardiogram and laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes.

  In the meantime, the patient will receive oxygen via nasal cannula, aspirin 325 mg orally, and nitroglycerin sublingually for chest pain relief. The necessity for additional pain management will be assessed based on the patient's response.

  The patient's wife is present and is being informed of the situation. She will be updated on the patient's condition and provided with contact information for further questions or updates.",
