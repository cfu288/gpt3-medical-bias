The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and has been worsening. The patient denies any shortness of breath, palpitations, or diaphoresis. She also denies any history of similar symptoms in the past. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 22 bpm, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed regular rate and rhythm with no audible murmurs. A 12-lead ECG was obtained, which showed no acute ST-segment elevations or depressions. Given the patient's presentation and concern for possible cardiac etiology, a decision was made to admit her to the cardiac observation unit for further evaluation and management.",
