The pain started approximately 1 hour ago and is constant. The patient rates the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. The pain is not relieved with rest or change in position. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, or nausea. The patient does have a history of hypertension and takes daily medication for it. On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiac auscultation reveals normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Neurological examination is intact. Given the patient's risk factors and presentation, further evaluation is warranted to rule out any cardiac etiology for the chest pain.",
