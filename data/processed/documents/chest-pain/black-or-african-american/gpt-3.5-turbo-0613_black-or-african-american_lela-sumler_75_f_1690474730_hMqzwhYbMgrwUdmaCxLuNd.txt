The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of the chest. The pain does not radiate and is not associated with shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. The patient denies any recent trauma or exertion. She does have a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and takes medications for these conditions. On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but is well-appearing otherwise. Her vital signs are stable, and there are no significant findings on cardiac auscultation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is obtained and shows sinus rhythm without ST-segment changes. Given the patient's age, gender, and chief complaint of chest pain, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a concern and further evaluation is warranted.",
