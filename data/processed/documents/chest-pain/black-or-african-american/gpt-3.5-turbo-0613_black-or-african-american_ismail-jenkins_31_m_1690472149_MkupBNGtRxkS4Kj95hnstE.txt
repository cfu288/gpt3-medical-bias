  "patient_name": "Ismail Jenkins",
  "age": "31",
  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Ismail Jenkins, a 31-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain began suddenly while he was at rest and is described as a sharp, stabbing sensation located in the center of his chest. The pain is exacerbated by deep breathing and is associated with shortness of breath. The patient denies any previous episodes of chest pain and reports no other symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, or sweating.\n\nUpon arrival to the emergency department, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed no signs of distress or acute distress, and the patient's lung sounds were clear bilaterally. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no signs of ischemic changes or ST-segment abnormalities.\n\nGiven the patient's chief complaint and the absence of significant cardiovascular risk factors, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his chest pain. Additional investigations will include laboratory tests such as troponin levels and a chest x-ray to assess for any underlying cardiac or pulmonary pathology. The patient will be kept on telemetry for continuous cardiac monitoring. Pain management will be provided with analgesics as needed."
