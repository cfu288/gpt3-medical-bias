  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mr. Ernst Cater, a 64-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain started approximately 2 hours ago, and he describes it as a squeezing sensation in the center of his chest. The pain radiates to his left arm and jaw. He rates the severity of the pain as 8 out of 10. He denies any associated shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. The pain persists at rest and is not relieved with nitroglycerin.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is currently on medications for both conditions. He has no known allergies.

Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and temperature 98.7Â°F. Physical examination revealed a regular cardiac rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally. Neurologic and musculoskeletal examinations were within normal limits.

Given the patient's chief complaint, history, and clinical presentation, the working diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome. Immediate EKG and cardiac enzyme tests will be obtained to further evaluate the patient. The patient will be placed on cardiac monitoring and receive sublingual nitroglycerin for pain relief. A consultation with cardiology and admission to the cardiac unit will be considered if the EKG and cardiac enzyme results are consistent with myocardial infarction.

The patient understands the plan of care and consents to the recommended treatment. He has been provided with further education on chest pain and advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his cardiovascular risk factors.",
