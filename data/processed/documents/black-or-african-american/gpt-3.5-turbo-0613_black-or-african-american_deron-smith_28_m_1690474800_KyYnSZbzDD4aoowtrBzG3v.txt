He describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation in the center of his chest that started approximately 1 hour ago. He rates the pain as 8/10 in intensity. He denies any associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or radiation of the pain to his left arm. The pain is not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. The patient has no past medical history of cardiovascular disease, but he does smoke half a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 10 years. The patient denies any recent illnesses or trauma. On physical examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and diaphoretic. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung examination is normal, with clear breath sounds bilaterally. There are no abdominal findings on examination. Neurologic examination is grossly intact. Skin is warm and dry.
