  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Adrienne Wilson, is a 46-year-old female presenting to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain began approximately 2 hours ago while she was at rest. She describes the pain as a dull, pressure-like sensation located in the center of her chest. The pain has not radiated to her arms, jaw, or back. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She has no prior history of cardiovascular disease and is unsure if any family members have a history of cardiac events. She has tried taking over-the-counter antacids for symptom relief, but the pain has not significantly improved. Given the concerning nature of her symptoms, an evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome is warranted.",
