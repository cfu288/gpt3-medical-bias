The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a squeezing sensation in the center of the chest. He rates the pain as 8 out of 10 in intensity and states that it radiates to his left arm. He denies associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea. The pain has not improved with rest. He has a history of coronary artery disease and has had a stent placed in the past. Given the concern for acute coronary syndrome, an electrocardiogram was obtained and showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. The patient was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent coronary angiography.",
