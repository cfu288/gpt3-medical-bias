The pain started suddenly and is located in the center of his chest. He describes the pain as a crushing sensation that radiates to his left arm. The pain is associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He denies any recent trauma or exertion. Upon arrival, his vital signs were stable except for an elevated blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg. He has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. Given the possibility of a cardiac event, an electrocardiogram was obtained, which showed changes consistent with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He was immediately started on aspirin and given nitroglycerin sublingually. He has been admitted to the cardiac care unit for further management.",
