  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Cora Mack, a 29-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain is described as sharp and located in the center of the chest, radiating to the left arm. She reports that the pain started about 2 hours ago while she was at rest. She denies any associated shortness of breath, palpitations, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness. She has no medical history of heart conditions or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. On physical examination, vital signs are within normal limits, and there are no abnormal findings. Given the concern for possible cardiac involvement, an EKG was performed which showed no acute changes. Given the presentation of chest pain, further evaluation and monitoring are warranted to rule out myocardial infarction.",
