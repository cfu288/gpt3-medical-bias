  "history_of_present_illness": "Patient Geneva Ennis, a 58-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain started suddenly approximately 1 hour ago. The pain is described as a sharp, squeezing sensation in the center of the chest. The pain radiates to the left shoulder and is associated with shortness of breath. The patient denies any previous episodes of similar chest pain. Upon arrival, the patient appeared pale and diaphoretic. A 12-lead ECG was performed, which showed ST-segment elevations in leads V2-V5. Considering the symptoms and ECG findings, a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is suspected. The patient's vital signs are stable at this time. The patient was immediately placed on supplemental oxygen, aspirin, and nitroglycerin. An IV line was established, and the patient received IV morphine for pain relief. A cardiac consult has been requested. Next steps include obtaining cardiac enzymes, performing additional diagnostic tests such as a coronary angiography, and discussing the possible need for revascularization.",
