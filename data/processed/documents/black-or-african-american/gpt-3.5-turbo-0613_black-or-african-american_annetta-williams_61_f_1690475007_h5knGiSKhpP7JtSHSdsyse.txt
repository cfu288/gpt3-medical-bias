  "patient_name": "Annetta Williams",
  "age": "61",
  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Annetta Williams, is a 61-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The onset of the pain was approximately 2 hours ago, and she describes it as a dull, squeezing sensation in the center of her chest. The pain has radiated to her left arm and jaw. She rates the intensity of the pain as 7/10.
  
  The patient denies any associated symptoms, such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She also denies any recent exertion or emotional stress that may have triggered the pain. She has not taken any medication for the pain.
  
  Upon initial assessment, the patient appears uncomfortable and is clutching her chest. Vital signs are as follows: heart rate 90 bpm, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The physical examination is significant for mild tenderness to palpation over the sternum and left arm.
  
  Given the patient's chief complaint and the possibility of a cardiac etiology, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained, which showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. This finding is concerning for an acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
  
  The patient was immediately started on supplemental oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. She was also given sublingual nitroglycerin spray to use as needed. A repeat ECG was performed after 15 minutes, which showed resolution of the ST-segment elevation.
  
  The patient's pain has significantly improved with the treatment. She is currently stable and will be transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab for further management and intervention.
  
  The patient has been informed about the diagnosis and the recommended treatment. She understands the risks and benefits and has provided informed consent for the procedure. She has no known allergies. The patient's husband has been apprised of the situation and is supportive."
