  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Alva Mcrae, is a 58-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The chest pain started approximately 2 hours ago while she was at rest. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation over the central chest, radiating to the left arm. The patient denies any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She has a history of hypertension and takes medications for it. She does not have a known history of coronary artery disease or angina. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious but is in no acute distress. Vital signs are stable and within normal limits. There are no abnormal heart sounds or murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. There are no significant findings on exam to suggest an acute abdominal or musculoskeletal cause for the patient's chest pain. Given her risk factors and the nature of her symptoms, concern for myocardial infarction cannot be excluded at this time.",
