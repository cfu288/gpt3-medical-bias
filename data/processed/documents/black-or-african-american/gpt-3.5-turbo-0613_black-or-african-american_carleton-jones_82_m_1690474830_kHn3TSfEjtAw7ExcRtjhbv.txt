The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is localized to the center of the chest. He describes the pain as a squeezing sensation, radiating to his left arm. The pain is associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. The patient denies any exertional component to the pain and states that it occurred at rest. He has no history of similar symptoms in the past. Given the severity of the symptoms and concerns for a possible cardiac event, an immediate EKG was performed which showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction.",
