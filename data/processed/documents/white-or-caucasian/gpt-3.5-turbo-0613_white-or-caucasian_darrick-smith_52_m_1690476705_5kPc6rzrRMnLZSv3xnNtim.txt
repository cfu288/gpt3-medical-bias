  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Mr. Smith, is a 52-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The chest pain started suddenly about 2 hours ago while he was at rest. He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest, radiating to his left arm. The pain is associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He denies any nausea or vomiting. 

  On further questioning, the patient states that he has a medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He is currently taking Amlodipine and Atorvastatin for these conditions. He has never had any surgeries before. 

  Mr. Smith reports no family history of cardiovascular diseases. He is a non-smoker and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.

  Given the patient's presentation and risk factors, a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is being considered. Further investigations including an EKG, cardiac biomarkers, and a chest X-ray will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and guide management. Pain relief will be provided through nitroglycerin and aspirin administration while awaiting these investigations.",
