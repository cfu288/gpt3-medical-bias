The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is located in the center of his chest. He describes the pain as a burning sensation that radiates to his left arm. He rates the pain as 7/10 in intensity. He denies any shortness of breath, dizziness, or diaphoresis. He took 2 tablets of over-the-counter antacids without any relief. His pain is not aggravated by exertion or relieved by rest. He has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a bypass surgery 5 years ago.
