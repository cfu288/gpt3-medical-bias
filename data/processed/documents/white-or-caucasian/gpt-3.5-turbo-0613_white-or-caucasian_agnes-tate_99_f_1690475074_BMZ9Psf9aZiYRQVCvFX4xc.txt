She reports that the pain started suddenly about 2 hours ago and is located in the center of her chest. The pain is described as sharp and intermittent. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. The patient reported no recent trauma or exertion that could have precipitated the pain.

Given the patient's age and chief complaint, further evaluation is warranted to rule out any cardiac etiology of the chest pain.",
