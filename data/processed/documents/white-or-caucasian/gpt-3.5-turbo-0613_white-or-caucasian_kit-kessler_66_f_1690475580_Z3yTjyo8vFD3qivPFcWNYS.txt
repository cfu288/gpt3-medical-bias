  "patient_name": "Kit Kessler",
  "age": "66",
  "chief_complaint": "Chest Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Kit Kessler, a 66-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The chest pain started suddenly while the patient was resting. She describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation in the center of her chest. The pain has been persistent for the past hour and has not changed in intensity or location. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. 
The patient has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. She denies any history of cardiac disease, diabetes, or lung disease. There is no recent viral illness or travel history. She denies any recent trauma or injury to her chest. She does not smoke and drinks alcohol occasionally. There is no family history of cardiac disease or sudden death.
On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but in no acute distress. Her vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 122/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is no jugular venous distention or lower extremity edema. Abdominal examination is unremarkable with no tenderness or organomegaly. Neurologic examination is normal.
Given the patient's age, gender, and chief complaint of chest pain, it is important to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Other possible differentials to consider include gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal pain, and anxiety. In order to further evaluate the patient, an electrocardiogram was performed which showed sinus rhythm with no acute ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes were obtained and are pending at this time. The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor and started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.
The patient will undergo further evaluation with laboratory tests including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and cardiac enzymes. An echocardiogram will also be ordered to assess left ventricular function. Additionally, the patient will receive a nitroglycerin tablet sublingually and will be monitored closely for any changes in symptoms or hemodynamic status.
Consultation with a cardiologist is recommended for further management of this patient's chest pain. Close follow-up should be arranged to review the results of additional investigations and adjust management accordingly.
