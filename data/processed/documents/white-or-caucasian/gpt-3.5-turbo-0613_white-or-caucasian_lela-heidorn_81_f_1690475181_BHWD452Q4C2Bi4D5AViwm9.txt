  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, an 81-year-old female named Lela Heidorn, presents to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain. The pain started approximately 1 hour ago and is described as a crushing sensation in the center of the chest. The patient rates the pain as 7/10 in severity. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. The patient states that she has never experienced this type of pain before and it is causing her significant distress. It is important to note that the patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. 

Regarding the onset, the pain began suddenly while the patient was sitting at home watching television. There were no precipitating factors or trauma preceding the onset of the pain. The patient did not try any home remedies or take any over-the-counter medications to relieve the pain before coming to the emergency department. 

The character of the pain is described as a pressure-like sensation that radiates to the left arm and jaw. The patient also reports feeling lightheaded. The pain is exacerbated by deep breaths and movement. The patient denies any alleviating factors that relieve the pain.

Considering the severity of the patient's symptoms and the possible cardiac etiology, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed immediately, which showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is suspected. Urgent cardiology consultation has been requested for further evaluation and management of the patient's condition."
