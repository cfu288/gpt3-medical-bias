  "history_of_present_illness": "Ms. Bunch is a 79-year-old female presenting to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. She reports that the pain started approximately 1 hour ago and is located in the center of her chest. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation and is radiating to her left arm. She rates the pain as 8/10 in severity. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. She has a history of hypertension and takes medication for it. The pain is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Given her age, gender, and location of the pain, I am concerned about the possibility of a myocardial infarction. Further evaluation and management are warranted.",
