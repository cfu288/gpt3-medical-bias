The patient reports that the pain began suddenly approximately 1 hour prior to arrival and is described as a sharp, stabbing pain in the center of her chest. The pain is aggravated by deep breaths and movement. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, or diaphoresis. She denies any recent trauma or injury. Upon further questioning, the patient reports a history of similar chest pain episodes in the past, but never to this severity. She denies any cardiac risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. The patient does not currently take any medications. Physical examination reveals no abnormal findings. EKG shows sinus rhythm with no ST segment elevations or depressions.
