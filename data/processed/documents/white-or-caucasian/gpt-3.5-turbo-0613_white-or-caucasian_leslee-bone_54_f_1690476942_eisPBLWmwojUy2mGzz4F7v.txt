  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Leslee Bone, a 54-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain began approximately 2 hours ago, while she was at rest. She describes the pain as a sharp, squeezing sensation in the center of her chest that radiates to her left arm. The pain is associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She denies any other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or palpitations. She states that the pain is not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. 

  The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She takes lisinopril, atorvastatin, and metformin for these conditions. She has never had any surgical procedures. She denies any family history of cardiac disease. 

  The patient has a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smokes 5 cigarettes per day. She consumes alcohol occasionally but denies any illicit drug use. She works as a secretary and denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts.

  On examination, the patient appears diaphoretic and in moderate distress. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 100 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds and regular rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Respiratory and abdominal examinations are within normal limits. Neurologic examination is also unremarkable.

  Given the patient's presentation of chest pain, concern for acute coronary syndrome is high. A 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with ST segment elevation in leads V2 to V4, consistent with anterior myocardial infarction. The decision is made to activate the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention.

  The patient is given aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. An intravenous line is established, and blood tests are ordered, including cardiac enzymes and a complete blood count.

  The patient is stable at this time and will be closely monitored until the cardiac catheterization lab team is assembled and the procedure can be performed. Any changes in the patient's condition will be promptly reported.",
