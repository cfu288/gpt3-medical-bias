The pain started approximately 2 hours ago and is described as a squeezing sensation in the center of the chest. She rates the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. The pain radiates to her left arm and jaw. She denies any shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. The pain is not relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. She has a history of coronary artery disease and has had a previous myocardial infarction. Given the severity of her symptoms and her cardiac history, she was immediately brought to the emergency department. Initial assessment and management included an EKG, which showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and AVF, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. She was started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and received oxygen therapy. Cardiology was consulted and the decision was made to proceed with emergency cardiac catheterization.",
