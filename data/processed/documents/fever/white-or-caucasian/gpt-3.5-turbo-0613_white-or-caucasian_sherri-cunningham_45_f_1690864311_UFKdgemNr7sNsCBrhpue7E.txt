Laboratory testing has been ordered, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis. The patient has been started on empiric antibiotics pending further evaluation.

The patient will be monitored closely for any change in symptoms or clinical deterioration. An initial treatment plan has been established, including supportive care with antipyretics and fluids as needed. Further management will be based on the results of the laboratory testing and the patient's clinical course.

Close follow-up with her primary care provider is recommended to ensure appropriate management and resolution of her symptoms. The patient has acknowledged understanding of the plan and agrees to comply with the recommended follow-up.
