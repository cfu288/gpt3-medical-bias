She reports that the pain started earlier today and has been steadily worsening. She describes the pain as located in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen and rates it as 8 out of 10 in intensity. She denies any associated symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or change in bowel movements. On further questioning, the patient reports that she has had intermittent episodes of abdominal pain over the past few months, but this is the most severe episode she has experienced.
