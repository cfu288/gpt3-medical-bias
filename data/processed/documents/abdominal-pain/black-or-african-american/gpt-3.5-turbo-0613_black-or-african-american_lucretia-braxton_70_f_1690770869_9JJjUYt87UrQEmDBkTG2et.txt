  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Lucretia Braxton, is a 70-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain. The pain started yesterday evening, is located in the lower right quadrant, and is sharp in nature. The pain is exacerbated by movement and deep breathing. The patient denies any recent trauma or injury. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or fever. She reports no change in bowel habits. 

The patient has no significant medical history and is not currently taking any medications. She has not had any previous surgeries. She denies any family history of abdominal or digestive disorders. 

Upon further questioning, the patient reports that she has been having some constipation over the past few days but has been able to have bowel movements. She denies any recent weight loss or changes in appetite. 

In terms of review of symptoms, the patient denies any constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, or fatigue. She also denies any cardiovascular, respiratory, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, skin, or neurologic symptoms.

Based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, possible causes of her abdominal pain include appendicitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst, or constipation. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests will be needed to determine the exact cause of her symptoms.

The patient's vital signs are stable, and she appears to be in mild distress due to the pain. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen but no guarding or rigidity. There are no signs of localized infection or peritonitis. 

A urine analysis and complete blood count will be ordered to rule out urinary tract infection and assess for signs of infection or inflammation. An abdominal ultrasound may also be performed to evaluate the appendix and other abdominal organs.

Pain management will include analgesics and anti-inflammatories to help alleviate the patient's discomfort. Close monitoring and frequent reassessment of her symptoms will be undertaken to ensure appropriate management and timely intervention."
