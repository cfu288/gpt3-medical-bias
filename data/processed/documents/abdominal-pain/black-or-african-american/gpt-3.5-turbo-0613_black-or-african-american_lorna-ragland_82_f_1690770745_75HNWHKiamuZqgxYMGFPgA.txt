The pain is located in the lower right quadrant and started earlier today. She describes it as sharp and constant, with a 7/10 intensity. There is no associated nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She denies any recent trauma or known triggers for the pain. On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and is guarding her abdomen. There is no rebound tenderness or rigidity. Bowel sounds are present and normal. The patient has a history of diverticulosis and is on a low-fiber diet. Given her age, the possibility of appendicitis is concerning. Further evaluation and investigations are needed to rule out other possible causes of her symptoms.",
