The pain started approximately 12 hours ago and is described as a sharp, crampy sensation in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen. The pain worsens with movement and is associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient denies any fever or changes in bowel movements. He has not taken any medication for the pain.

Upon further questioning, the patient reports no recent trauma, no known allergies, and no significant medical or surgical history. He denies any chronic illnesses and states that he is not currently taking any medications.

The patient does not have a family history of gastrointestinal disorders. He denies any tobacco or illicit drug use. He occasionally drinks alcohol in moderation.

On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable and is guarding his abdomen. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness and localized rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. There is no evidence of organomegaly or hernias. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Based on the history and examination findings, the differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, diverticulitis, and ovarian cyst rupture in females. Further evaluation with laboratory tests and imaging studies will be required to confirm the diagnosis. The patient will be started on IV fluids and scheduled for a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

The patient has been informed about the plan of care, including the risks and benefits of the diagnostic studies. He has provided informed consent and understands the need for further evaluation and possible surgical intervention.",
