She describes the pain as a constant, sharp, and severe in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. The pain started approximately 6 hours ago and has been gradually worsening. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel movements. 

The patient denies any recent trauma or falls. She has no known history of similar episodes in the past. She reports that she has been otherwise healthy with no chronic medical conditions. She states that she takes over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for headaches, but is not currently on any prescribed medications. She denies any recent surgeries or hospitalizations. 

It is important to note that the patient appears uncomfortable and is unable to find relief from changing positions. She denies any fever or chills. Upon physical examination, there is tenderness upon palpation of the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, with guarding but no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present and normal. 

Considering the location, severity, and duration of the pain, and the absence of other symptoms, the differential diagnosis for this patient includes appendicitis, ovarian cyst torsion, and urinary tract infection. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management."
