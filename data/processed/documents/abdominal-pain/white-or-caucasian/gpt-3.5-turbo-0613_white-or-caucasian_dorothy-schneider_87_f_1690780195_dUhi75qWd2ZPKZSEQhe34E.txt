According to the patient, the pain started this morning and is located in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. She describes the pain as sharp and constant, with a severity of 6 out of 10. She denies associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. She has not tried any medications for the pain. Her bowel movements have been regular and she has not noticed any blood in her stool. The patient states that she has not experienced this type of pain before and it is different from her usual abdominal discomfort due to her chronic diverticulosis. She denies any recent trauma or injury to the abdomen. Social history reveals that the patient lives alone and is independent in her activities of daily living. She denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diverticulosis. Medications include lisinopril and simvastatin. There is no past surgical history of note. Family history is significant for hypertension and diabetes. Overall, the patient's abdominal pain appears to be a new and different symptom for her, necessitating further evaluation to determine its cause and appropriate treatment.",
