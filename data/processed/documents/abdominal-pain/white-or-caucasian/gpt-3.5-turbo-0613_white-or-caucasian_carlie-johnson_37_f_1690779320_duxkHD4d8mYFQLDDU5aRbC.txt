  "patient_name": "Carlie Johnson",
  "age": "37",
  "chief_complaint": "Abdominal Pain",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain. The pain started earlier today and is located in the lower right quadrant. She describes the pain as sharp and constant. She denies any recent trauma or injury. No alleviating factors have been identified. She states that the pain has been increasing in severity since onset. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or fever. Upon further questioning, the patient reports a history of similar episodes of abdominal pain in the past, but never this severe. She denies any recent changes in bowel movements or urinary symptoms. Physical examination reveals tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant. Given the location and severity of the pain, appendicitis is a likely differential diagnosis. Further diagnostic evaluation is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential etiologies such as ovarian cyst torsion or kidney stones.",
