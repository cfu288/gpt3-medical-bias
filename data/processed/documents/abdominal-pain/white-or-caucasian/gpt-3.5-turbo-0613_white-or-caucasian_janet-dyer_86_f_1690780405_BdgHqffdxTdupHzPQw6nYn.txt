  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, Janet Dyer, an 86-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain. The pain started approximately 12 hours ago and is located in the upper right quadrant of her abdomen. She describes the pain as sharp and constant, with a severity of 7/10. The pain is not relieved by rest or change in position. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She states that she has not had any recent changes in her diet or activity level. The patient reports a past medical history of hypertension and osteoarthritis for which she takes lisinopril and acetaminophen, respectively. She denies any allergies to medications. There is no known family history of abdominal pain or gastrointestinal disease. The patient lives alone and is independent with her activities of daily living. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. On physical examination, the patient is afebrile with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the right upper quadrant with no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Given the patient's age and presentation, concerns for gastrointestinal pathology, such as cholecystitis or pancreatitis, are high. Abdominal imaging and laboratory studies, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and amylase/lipase, will be ordered to further evaluate the patient's condition. Pain management with intravenous analgesics will also be provided.",
