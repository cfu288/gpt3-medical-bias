The patient reports that the pain started suddenly approximately 4 hours ago and has been progressively worsening. She describes the pain as sharp and crampy, primarily located in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. The patient denies any associated symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits. She also denies any recent trauma or previous episodes of similar pain. It is important to note that the patient has a history of gallstones and was scheduled for a cholecystectomy next week, which she cancels due to COVID-19 concerns. Physical examination reveals tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Initial diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests and imaging studies, will be pursued to further evaluate the cause of the patient's abdominal pain.",
