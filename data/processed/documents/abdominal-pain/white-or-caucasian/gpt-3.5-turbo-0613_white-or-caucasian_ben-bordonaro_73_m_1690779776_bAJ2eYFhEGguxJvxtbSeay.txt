The pain started approximately 6 hours ago and is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Patient describes the pain as sharp and intermittent, and it worsens upon movement. He denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. On physical examination, abdominal tenderness and guarding are noted in the right lower quadrant.
